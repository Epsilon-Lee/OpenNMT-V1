thank you .
thank you .
thank you .

you can .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
that &apos;s true .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
it &apos;s ...
pretty simple .
thank you .
thank you .
three out of 10 .
thank you .
stephen watt .
rs .
thank you .
we go through it .
it &apos;s interesting .
very expensive real estate .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m a novelist .
is that reasonable ?
that &apos;s hard .
be foolish .
this is atlassian .
the sun goes on .
the orange tractor .
yes , hi .
fantastic , right ?
that &apos;s wrong .
long , yeah .
yes , milliseconds .
the only chance .
yes , yes ?
don &apos;t happen .
this is efficient .
all of the time .
not toxic inside .
but it goes .
yeah , sort of .
music as language .
it &apos;s slow .
i wonder .
that &apos;s the singing .
they need time .
a high school student .
this is fast .
here she is .
so this is peer-to-peer .
not very sustainable .
they &apos;re frowning . &quot;
that was fascinating .
an enormous challenge .
we need to go .
thank you . thank you .
rs : thank you .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s awful .
ambition . ambition .
he works this way .
very different term .
we know that .
rs : 60,000 .
and he says ...
a few less .
we were .
it has sensors .
i swear it .
does that sound good ?
after a week .
you can get through .
i sat awe .
thank you .
that was incredible .
no hospital .
thank you .
not yet .
this is scary .
it &apos;s generic .
yeah . okay .
a whole lot .
jk : both .
i can help .
i was amazed .
transported it together .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m tom .
thank you .
i created one .
are that all ?
we lose them .
oh my god !
rs .
there were syringes .
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
we were poor .
after home ?
centers were built .
again , my gut gut .
that &apos;s not ...
sh yourself .
we pick up .
i represent kids .
or bombs .
it would be unbearable .
it would be a straw .
we love innovation .
we love conversation .
oh my god .
sleep is ubiquitous .
there are superstar belts .
they &apos;re selling up .
they &apos;re tearing out each other .
thank you very much .
these days are over .
what do you want to do ?
they even hurt .
everybody needs a solar prize .
this was the result .
i think they &apos;re cloud-based .
can we change it ?
just do your job .
this is about the most sophisticated .
this was about christmas .
this is the last .
good work ! yes !
so let &apos;s see .
yeah , good afternoon .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
they had no mass media .
yes , this is .
what are media today ?
they have similar principles .
so why does this happen ?
does anybody see anything particular ?
one of the same things , right .
i look at the camel .
that &apos;s our present .
what &apos;s going to take in milliseconds ?
give a chance to give .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
let me tell you .
not a tree tree .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we can do it differently .
and it needs to go back .
wonderful .
but the wrong things .
what do they say ?
every waste is essential .
so , not like bermuda .
we can do that .
does it make it curious ?
the work of the trickster .
you compare .
all of this interest me .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
you see it immediately .
i can say everything .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
yeah , good afternoon .
the hot days today .
we were 20 people .
it &apos;s already .
this is the system .
what a fish .
i wanted to hire them .
let &apos;s call it the answer .
that &apos;s me .
what did you do ?
they were frowning .
the farm is incredible .
there &apos;s no food .
can i be honest ?
and i was an artist .
it was really profound .
who will make it safe ?
next one : bye .
that &apos;s great .
that &apos;s a wish .
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
who is the most successful ?
what was the result ?
there &apos;s also a whole lot .
and i understand that .
people were mad .
we &apos;re talking about it .
the data came in .
but you know what ?
not very often .
it &apos;s called paul delong-minutu .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
darker urine . dark .
there was no clan straw .
why do we do that ?
it &apos;s not a country .
because you know what ?
yeah , i know .
how do we know that ?
daniel libeskind : sure .
thank you danny mandelbrot .
so they do that .
it may sound nasty .
player don &apos;t sit around .
aluminum productivity . fantastic !
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
from conflicts , creativity creates creativity .
there &apos;s no normal .
oh , so the one .
that &apos;s very good .
a few more .
what about longevity ?
maybe 10 times .
he opens the door .
why no longer live ?
these are being towed .
so it &apos;s true .
they &apos;re all important .
be a mentor .
who are these related ?
play is not silly .
so where do we go ?
ooh , thank you .
thank you very much .
first extension , second .
italy win . yeah .
here &apos;s the video .
his name is transformational .
i was at him .
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
they did it .
that sounds scary .
you could see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
almost identical structure .
the power plant can explode .
i have a question .
that would have been okay .
this is very risky .
this is the most pessimistic .
woman &apos;s technology technology .
it keeps you fresh .
hmmm , my brand ?
my name is war-torn .
i look at this dungeon .
polite , all of the time .
first , simple .
but you know what ?
how they are interested .
let me wrap up .
so how does this work ?
what &apos;s happened here ?
there was jimmy apnea .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i lived in northern siberia .
i don &apos;t know .
is it even photography ?
what creates the illusion ?
oh . a moment .
okay . thank you .
so they meet al .
and that &apos;s important .
they use their hands .
there are two options .
i &apos;m going in here .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
silence is the silence .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we &apos;re constantly chasing each other .
i thought about it .
i don &apos;t think so .
that was great .
here &apos;s an example .
let &apos;s talk about professionalism .
what do these people need ?
hey , why not ?
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
1,000 , good .
i learned everything .
but i kept working .
and the nurse &apos;s office .
so she was back .
they gave her her loan .
their family turned together .
and she did .
and i kept working .
it actually collected fish .
it was a training project .
what &apos;s happened here ?
that &apos;s what happens today .
we have three main approaches .
these people deserve money .
this is alfred quach .
and it &apos;s a key tool .
privacy has to be given .
the stones are overlapping .
i will stop that .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
the living hand the spirits .
now , what does that mean ?
so what does that mean ?
nigel nations send our flu guide .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
the official of what &apos;s going on ?
these are all sorts of questions .
here &apos;s another example .
third , the expectations .
do you want your jeans with holes ?
but i felt bad .
we just signed up at first .
why should we do that ?
seriously -- the fall of water !
and i always had .
why not think about that ?
this is a year lapse .
these rivers take a long way .
the key ones have expanded .
let &apos;s leave it out .
they really loved it .
this is an interactive marketing .
... his own story invent .
so , what &apos;s hacking for now ?
this is what you see down there .
how do we actually work people ?
that &apos;s what happens to be unusual .
they didn &apos;t have books .
let &apos;s make a little bit of noise .
it &apos;s from the high school machine .
we &apos;re not producing ourselves .
that &apos;s not going to do it .
it was still going to work .
now , you see the wing .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
you have to understand that too .
that &apos;s what the so-called bee call .
and it depends on phosphorus .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
it &apos;s much more critical .
it &apos;s making leukemia at kids .
but that &apos;s not protection .
thankfully , not , yes ?
so we &apos;re too many .
but where are we useful ?
we can turn our nutrients back .
in china , it was different .
the byproduct is clean water .
but we need it all .
or take a property .
there &apos;s any footprint there .
we &apos;re in germany .
so there are two strands of cycles .
all of this is volcanic dioxide .
that has got to be invented .
he was about 60 .
his personal health decisions .
that &apos;s what most people know here .
this is like the sex pack .
that &apos;s what you can train .
have you ever been jealous ?
it &apos;s against justice .
it &apos;s always becoming more and more .
it &apos;s interested in the interest .
he signed up .
because i can say everything .
these things are logical correctly .
that &apos;s not the soul .
so this is a sort of a mess .
this is what we &apos;ve imagined .
it &apos;s busy .
there are four and a thousand people living there .
this is simply technological .
what would have to be done ?
and here &apos;s the picture again .
and then they set up .
i only loved two .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
two and a half , great .
let &apos;s call it also hands .
it &apos;s kind of like this .
the chef had his name .
he pointed on the algae .
but what do you eat ?
how is the key line ? &quot;
they eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
i almost never cook with it .
i don &apos;t like that question .
you want to feed the world ?
now i see greg mandelbrot .
so they saw something magical .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what do we learn ?
it &apos;s been deeply available .
first we have the population .
today , carlos billion people live .
this is a lot of volume .
and also , these sources of descent .
and there &apos;s the magic team .
it really solves the design system .
how should our testimony look ?
this has the largest impact .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to spread the message .
this is just a 3d camera .
and even you think about it .
it was a huge success .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and then realizing it .
so i tried something interesting now .
what do you think happened ?
there &apos;s a superstar there .
and why is this ?
rs , 93 , polio ...
the result of this was catastrophic .
does anyone here have hyun-sook ?
so paul is a terrorist .
the data is all over .
i &apos;ll agree with you .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i &apos;ll push my sleeve back .
but the key thing is , ...
yeah , here it is .
there &apos;s very much more sophisticated .
but it didn &apos;t .
he had the experience .
there &apos;s an old study .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
they have so much uncertainty .
so the correlation is small .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
and there are plenty of employees .
so the first step in primate .
and finally , epic significance .
they create a epic story .
edward paravicini is a video designer .
it sounds crazy , right ?
we &apos;ve been playing with warcraft .
the game is from 2007 .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
i think rather not .
how about fitness ?
is this all fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
some are arrived and left .
sexual reproduction is in the image .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
it cost billions of dollars .
these changes are coming in .
who doesn &apos;t want to be healthier ?
game doesn &apos;t just matter .
and this is what they call them .
so what happened for years ?
and women do succeed .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
will it have my height ?
will i like the color ?
good afternoon , all together .
here you see the city .
you see the timeline up .
they saw the big divergence .
and then everybody went down .
it really liked him .
you can have this cloud .
this is what you &apos;re looking at .
here you see it .
it &apos;s completely paralyzed today .
no insurance can travel .
it turns the engines off .
i had a good life .
it feels great .
you see the water coming .
but it was very sad .
and then something funny happened .
and that worked very well .
and it got better .
but it gets worse .
is that your opinion ?
i &apos;m a recovering person .
that was more to arguing .
put the camera out .
what else is there ?
we &apos;re a smaller token .
that &apos;s a great question .
and this is a design project .
thank you very much .
yeah . well , good .
the shipping is very good .
what other brands are doing ?
that &apos;s a great question .
and it took 18 months .
i grew up in india .
so you &apos;re just going to go too fast .
just further . a lot of fun .
these are all the metadata .
you see a funny thing here .
apparently it was quite popular .
they come from artists .
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
and again , it showed him .
the two called me .
it &apos;s just a thousand square kilometers .
one place is south korea .
here &apos;s the oil gang .
here &apos;s your gait .
so the third technology , the third technology .
so here are two different approaches .
okay , a few more .
what am i looking at ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
and then it became international .
it &apos;s a little bit more whimsical in me .
loans and sponsors were searching .
so i followed my gut gut .
after just a trip there .
is it about the light ?
here &apos;s another example .
but it requires a lot of planning .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
i work in the ted community .
they &apos;re expanding rapidly out .
scott is going to get this double .
they connected these two people .
have you seen these guys ?
something very strange here .
they look like this .
it &apos;s about it .
it has billions of them .
you might have some mutations .
but they do the job .
so it creates a feedback feedback .
that really made me sad .
but what do we do about it ?
and this opens up a map .
these are the main guys .
my cousins all around him .
i will never forget .
i will never forget that .
my brother kept me off .
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to admit you something .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
we lost the contact .
the only country in the world .
and i represent people in northern africa .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
we love technology and creativity .
she &apos;s going deeply touch .
we want to spontaneously eliminate . &quot;
sometimes i press too much .
so i went to the court .
once the judge saw me .
he went down and off .
what else can we do ?
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
crisis . disaster . disaster .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
and many people forget that .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
we &apos;re thinking about this today .
and there &apos;s good news .
and she &apos;s beating a little bit .
and so it was .
i felt really good .
i actually made two mistakes .
my second mistake was worse .
and the main thing was all the strands .
and then it happened again .
he always showed up here .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
and it &apos;s the key line .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
my name is brian dickens .
it &apos;s about professionalism .
it was my first cloned .
maturity measure five inches .
they were genetically modified .
they were still fish .
this is a dead turtle .
once we started , we started an alive .
she wasn &apos;t drowning .
but it &apos;s not going to document .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
what do you deal with ?
this is right here .
they tap into their internet connection .
privacy is not the debate .
so it &apos;s open source source .
they &apos;re the requirement of somebody .
our magazines are going to be read by millions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
a has these benefits and risks .
now , everything is easy to have .
the answer is yes .
second , what economists call oxytocin .
they could have done better .
so let me remind you .
economists call this a social application .
we built unique elements here .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
it caused huge amounts of control in the control room .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
okay , that &apos;s really the courage .
that &apos;s how you know .
so the question is : how ?
what &apos;s this thing ?
go and tear leonard cohen .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
it &apos;s labeled with red .
this is a totally valid tool .
this picture reminded me of something .
here he is putting the sun up .
now i add a bass .
it was a pretty nice project .
or they didn &apos;t have any marketing .
no , no , far missing .
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is a game out of the outside .
for example , this perception of context .
does anybody know what that is ?
so it &apos;s &apos; n .
this is also a paradigm shift .
then i can transmit this whole .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
we depend on two countries .
and that &apos;s what we do .
people over the urine .
there &apos;s no marketing in trees .
and so we &apos;re too many .
imagine mozart efficient .
this is just the minimum .
it &apos;s not all to be of course .
so , for example , yes , yes ?
technical data is the same thing .
if you &apos;re at the moment , the trash is .
i started a institute .
so basically , an translation of translation .
the motivation to write it .
how did he feel that ?
have a nice physical example of this .
this is a bit of a mess .
because for me , she means memory .
now , the instruments have moved .
it was just not invented .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
and how did that feel ?
i &apos;m going to shoot something through my head .
the mechanism is from lying .
picasso says , just wait .
my wife told me it .
here you have this little mechanism .
we can &apos;t just do that .
and then he can just tip .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
so i jumped it across here .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
he &apos;s automatically running to the right idea .
and here you have it again .
and you have a problem .
thank you for your attention .
they always say , why ?
it can &apos;t be a problem .
and then it turns out , it &apos;s fair .
so , it &apos;s going to come up , you know .
and of course , this is incredibly crude .
this is going to happen in the next april .
for nathaniel , music is emotional health .
i hope you forgive me .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i said , &quot; huh ?
i &apos;m going out of this fish .
and amazingly he was still delicious .
and it was a disaster .
they literally cleaned the lever .
rs ? i was completely confused .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
he shook his head , no .
this is an environmental network .
a billion people are being starving today .
creativity had to hold out .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
that &apos;s why i did the movie .
they live with the help of billie .
it really changed the dynamics .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
in fact , it &apos;s based on top .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so this is a tough one .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
this is going to be a key feature of this .
they shouldn &apos;t be suffering under other things .
the marshmallow needs to be up .
they don &apos;t invest a time in education .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
my grandparents dragged up this number on top .
we cleaned them up . pop .
so that &apos;s the good news .
same thing , only bigger .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
and that kind of mess me up ...
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
nobody has ever said that before .
they feel good . &quot;
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
we &apos;re genetically modified food .
and why ? raise food .
it &apos;s about like a potato .
because we don &apos;t want to move genes ?
also , the harvest is a role .
and the shape is a role .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
so , what a story is like ?
they didn &apos;t change the story .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
but it &apos;s definitely not a trivial thing .
so this crazy story could be voices .
so , we can also .
i &apos;ll read you the post .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
wiser is just to our lives .
honestly -- who &apos;s normal ?
i was very much normal at that time .
the students are divided into grades .
do you want more attractive and more confident ?
which one would you like most ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
now , how did this happen ?
and this was 19 years ago .
well , i was the next one .
it &apos;s got to me .
but the game is a pivot .
both these are handmade , both up .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tiger .
monday : color is powerful .
tuesday : adapt is totally inclusive .
thursday : confidence is key .
they become a computer in the open .
in the morning , before the game .
the game starts -- silence .
the data wasn &apos;t available before .
the whole building was made of water .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
they can play with different species .
this is about five feet long .
and this video is in real time .
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
this was the beginning of the journey .
we won some prizes .
this is a picture of a circle .
she did it for three years .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
so , we start with a fragrance .
that &apos;s a piece , right ?
completely on a particular goal .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
this is just the most talkative .
we need to think about what brands .
that would have been no problem at all .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
a whole dish looks cool food .
we &apos;re talking about audacious , fresh .
these things have a more important effect .
how would you describe your brand ?
i really like beautiful clothes .
lawyer : i &apos;m a hippie student .
tell me about this world .
what else do you have through that ?
rs ! no , thank you .
or are you more likely to be a more skeptical ?
the film was not going to be either .
you &apos;re walking around and mica .
you want to orient in the museum ?
now this is one of the images .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you now .
that &apos;s not what i should say .
you can be logically and intuitively .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is a picture of the object .
and we did that .
so we measured his movement .
we are in an area .
this is a picture of this place .
they even bring funding in .
think of your own decisions .
now we saw the opposite effect .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
here &apos;s a description of the road .
okay , there are some .
this is a very high motivator .
who do you actually want to inform ?
we have to slowly increase the complexity .
motors , gears -- four options .
well , let &apos;s do it .
he had uploaded to a lot of deaf .
what happened this day ?
that &apos;s it , very simple .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
who could have predicted all of this ?
the story is not over .
i never met him personally .
no , no way .
her mother moved her alone .
the defeat would have been too simple .
who would ever have a wish ?
i believed everybody could .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and nevertheless , a realistic plane .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
this is from a quarry .
how can we help you ? &quot;
and every morning i get to that .
and we &apos;ve made a design model .
... it &apos;s given the attention .
this is a modest little app .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
it &apos;s not just a call a call .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
good night , sweet chris . &quot;
so , the production has done it .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
but that &apos;s not that fast .
we &apos;re not going to go on .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
and these are the neural dynamics .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
all these generations need a few milliseconds .
it &apos;s obscure and strange programs .
so , playing the technology .
we &apos;re in the middle of this window .
now we do this with airplanes .
i got a bit scared of technology .
this storytelling used to have more sense .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
somehow the children don &apos;t do anymore .
we use the energy of the sun .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
she was a daughter &apos;s daughter .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is probably going to be broadcast publicly .
my uncle died of antiretroviral diseases .
many of my clients are very young .
this is a very sensitive question .
i talk a lot about these questions .
do you want in the middle and listen ? &quot;
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
you should also be the wish .
then he started to the ear .
well , i walked up .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
&quot; a blue blue closed . &quot;
because we live on a watering life .
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the air chain .
we have a passion for a laser .
we have the capital of the food industry .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
it &apos;s the requirement of the barn .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
but , you know what ?
i was a pessimistic student student .
she was back and she was dying .
but slowly , it turns out .
i started feeling better .
they &apos;re embarrassed alone and without support .
but there are two problems with this .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
all of these things are error inevitable .
and it starts with a doctor .
it divides their experience with others .
i &apos;m the closest doctor .
people still were happy .
and no one seems to have a difference .
licklider &apos;s hacking and nasty hack .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
lego made it possible for everybody .
and it was an incredible experience .
and of course , we all share the same species .
a language is expression of the human mind .
54 percent of the deaths happened through education .
the great man &apos;s grandfather refused .
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
but these are all roads in the u.s.
let &apos;s take a step out now .
many of them are lifted up from faces and so forth .
this is my supermarket . not a big deal .
and there are several reasons for this .
here &apos;s a couple of on the hamptons .
everyone in my lab &apos;s neighborhood is gone .
now , this cartoon is a few statements .
the truth is more like this .
we started 15 years ago .
it turns out that it &apos;s very difficult .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
this is the evolution of evolution here .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
we cleaned them up to new zealand .
like algae -- and other frightening things .
if not , somebody else today .
his whole process has changed afterwards .
the fact is , coal is dirty .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
it &apos;s about a corporate of america .
i start with some simple examples .
so , for him , they were just just scratched .
we wanted to develop a design program for surveillance .
so , that was my primary motivation .
and the list , you can continue endlessly .
it &apos;s more than these other two networks .
and that &apos;s really in the beginning .
now , what are actually more striking models ?
i want to prove that to you .
and this is what &apos;s going on as a commodity age .
on the book and the picture .
we have an abstract language .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
maybe again , a glimpse of this .
so , from modern to the modern .
every society is shaped by a solar cell .
it was the beginning of the language .
that the topic of ecology is a global .
often in the third , again .
you start looking at the back .
i don &apos;t know who what recognizes .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
it only has to process as a present .
how do i make something more appropriate ?
and it &apos;s less energy , less or worse .
and what does that mean for designers ?
i &apos;m trying to do this by example .
now , everyone has been eating cake .
and curiosity doesn &apos;t learn how to learn .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , the environment , fewer energy .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
and everything is packaging or content .
one baby needs about six megabytes .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
that means we need to cover phosphorus .
but all of a sudden , yes ?
it &apos;s not efficient , it &apos;s efficiency .
questions about what is the right thing ?
we think about the north .
so not saving , prevents , avoid .
you can show , i was there .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown .
so there &apos;s this kind of direct design model .
if you get to that , yeah ?
all around these creeks are around , almost .
we can reinvent everything else .
so every concert is another concert .
there he was and he said , &quot; so ?
he only lived for years .
on interpretation , they &apos;re not talking about interpretation .
and yet it &apos;s still no interpretation .
tell that what they feel .
it &apos;s not just a nice test .
and this sounds very different from it before .
so the first step to a interpretation .
behind the seven mountains and so forth .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
because now you can use an online app .
they &apos;re still familiar with school .
and in this room , there are three sentences coming in .
and here you feel it .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
these sentences are absolutely logical and accurate .
tell me , there &apos;s no marketing .
there was the most talkative .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
you put this box .
we also have very precise data .
how far do you get there ?
and then we said , okay .
very simple , it &apos;s going to come .
so i just started playing .
music is medicine . music is changing .
and this is how it &apos;s his rivalries , conditions .
bruno nilekani : thank you very much . thank you .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
they have the river of the water .
this is where he comes up with a rare pair of glass .
now , he was mentioning by phytoplankton .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
it &apos;s a key , but it &apos;s also a design system .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
it &apos;s this nylon taste , evocative taste .
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
you can dive into a certain year .
we &apos;re talking about the oscar curse .
so i &apos;m listening to that , thank you .
i was totally troubled , you know .
i could draw . i could paint .
but i didn &apos;t let them get frustrated .
so , basically my two passions .
so , that really blew me up .
we went back to the train of the titanic .
so that was a very strange experience .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
for energy , this fell on me .
so here are some natural fireflies .
it should contain the two elements again .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff that needs to come together .
we need to use more research research .
anyway , we need a solution .
rs : a solar game is most important .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
but there &apos;s another reason .
because they have special skills in the world .
what do you think happened to this ?
we repeated this exercise with the same student .
and that can make a big difference .
and everyone in this room needs to be inside .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
not even the truth will be free .
we now have measles in this country .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we &apos;re going to the poor people &apos;s hands .
they &apos;re getting into southern africa , in south africa .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s the same morality , morality .
so , look what happens .
and the goal is very simple .
i think the knife in my hand .
what ? that really got me crazy .
i normally would take the needle out .
everybody would like to make the people happier .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
there seems to be a disagreement .
we &apos;re going to get an absolutely flat line .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
no , i mean it really seriously .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet , you haven &apos;t heard it .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
five million people use it every month .
and these amazing objections were there .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
they shared the kingdom in two quarters .
here &apos;s the version version version of this .
we can give ourselves something like this .
maybe we can see mediocrity as change .
but what will happen in the future ?
this is about one percent of the population population .
i remember my first fire .
and you know what i learned ?
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
it &apos;s in many different forms .
so we have this awful simplistic idea .
they had a concept of blue blood .
we &apos;re seeing the same thing at the same time .
how do you impress people because of their characters ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
do we really want to go to that direction ?
in fact , in this way , we don &apos;t exist .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
just be who you are .
wednesday : hold your inner kid .
it &apos;s called &quot; talking to me . &quot;
let &apos;s start with the sense .
it was developed four times in italy .
it was impossible to win the air industry .
and no matter italy won &apos;t .
second blew . close to normal .
so , in a moment of trade .
we called it the digital water .
the roof was also covered with water .
you can do that all the time .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
but the truth is far away .
this is the average size of a nanotube .
and that was the outbreak of war .
he can only use his eyes .
thank you very much indeed .
this is something like our cottage system .
it all comes from our own pockets .
and i had to go out of town .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
he says , &quot; look at the edge . &quot;
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
this didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
okay , you really want to know ?
i went to jail -- hard .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
what kind of words would you put together ?
man 3 : i &apos;m the most talkative .
man &apos;s 5 : brand 5 / 7 .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i like things that are different .
the first one is a classic , apple .
or are they more like a millionaire ?
are you mindful and refreshing such as iconic ?
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
the name is called &quot; transparency . &quot;
thank you , but the best part is still .
you can get very easily in and forth .
but then you really want deep inside .
another layer of mine from me , i met .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
let &apos;s think about atoms .
it &apos;s just the precise thing that makes you agree .
the rest of the time is they &apos;re tuned .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
this is more than 250 thousand acres .
it &apos;s also very interested in the same way .
they had different kinds of dna types of dna .
and i want to read to you the likes .
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
oh my god . oh my god .
in fact , no viral video wanted to make a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
even cats look at this video .
nobody needs to give your ideas green light .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through history .
all adults were aware of the risks .
no apple ever tasted it again .
my mom was suffering from the boat .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the objection .
there had to be a different model .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a dime .
we worked late to the night .
her father died shortly after her birth .
&quot; they won &apos;t leave them . &quot;
secondly , there &apos;s a lot of life that should be identical .
it &apos;s from a different place .
we &apos;ve all got our cars in our cars .
and sure enough , we can find ourselves .
today , i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
oh , my time is over ?
so there &apos;s a nice little dynamic game .
and that worked . for scott .
scott oliver : human beings .
rs ? yes . alive ? aid .
so every droplet was a little different .
they started to abstract information again .
it could be used within a time of time .
store this one , the rest of the rest .
i tried to understand them .
with 16 , i started to illustrate books .
it can know where we are .
i learned this from my grandmother .
there &apos;s a few basic developments .
we &apos;ve already been running a lot .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
i think our identity is threatened .
we want to do something about the death penalty system .
we want to lower the numbers of death .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all do .
he came to me and gave me a magician .
i had written these crazy things .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
it was the shepherd &apos;s chair against drugs .
but maybe this is not the case .
child mortality has a tenth of a tenth .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and we &apos;re increasing our expectations constantly .
now look at this curve .
notice two things about this curve .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
but the king of gandhian engineering did get a lot .
it &apos;s powered by oxygen and water .
what will these three billion people bring ?
so far , this was a supercomputer for supercomputer .
you know , how do you call a fragrance ?
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
and give it feedback to my favorite point .
maybe i did it with good reason .
they barely breathe , and they were blue .
they put them in the front door .
she didn &apos;t have prescribed to him .
this is the kind of darwinian shame .
but i asked myself this question .
why did i go to medicine ?
at one point , i thought he was going on .
it &apos;s a totally denial of errors .
i thought i could integrate myself .
if you put it together , what happens .
the difference will be seen as a loss .
there can be a sequence of changes .
that &apos;s basically our goal now .
so you don &apos;t often lose more sophisticated animals .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
but western governments also help themselves .
but today we are far beyond that .
we &apos;ve also brought up food systems .
the key is the great legacy of humanity .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
it &apos;s our new home system , and it &apos;s called asknature.org. .
every big picture is the beginning of one section .
or other models , or even technical orthodoxy .
the top top of the nasa &apos;s picture of nasa .
there are the ones that are much spatial .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception .
yeah . it doesn &apos;t make anything else .
and the official official organization of all western societies .
i just want to quickly say a little bit about five inches .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
in other areas , the world of communication .
we negotiated no identity ; we invent them .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
they &apos;re worried about that we &apos;re bad for .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it &apos;s a little virus killing bacteria .
they laughed more than you do here .
so , this looks like a slot machine .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it has over 300 million million .
it &apos;s going to give a challenge for nine .
we take images of these online detectors in detectors .
it just wasn &apos;t , you know ?
oh , jesus , what a thought !
everybody knew your genius was paralyzed .
that &apos;s about the land on them .
if your job is dancing , dancing .
and if not , dance still dance .
she grows in the winter winter in the summer .
this is the peak river in southwest greenland .
but we start to see change .
they saw it in the news .
it &apos;s a clean , clean one day .
this is one , part of her .
coal coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean water .
the americas is new . find more out .
we have to come far , and that &apos;s fast .
and these interactive portraits are taking each other together .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and moves .
this is our youngest experiment at the bottom right there .
now he &apos;s catching a tractor into the scene .
now i &apos;m going to do something about some drums .
i can use the sequence while it &apos;s going to change .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what &apos;s going on ?
as i said , it only started .
and that &apos;s what they do .
now , if you think about a piece of bits .
but i &apos;ll talk about it again .
and then this is the essence of the pre-industrial cultures .
what &apos;s left us is the most complex .
i want to quickly explain this a little bit .
and these two are also here today .
this is a subject for natural user interface .
to say , what &apos;s information ?
and then further , you see him .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to say to the norm .
and there &apos;s a central point .
we can , of course , look at this .
this is going to be balanced in china .
because that &apos;s what we &apos;ve learned , right ?
have you ever seen a tree tree ?
we can support them , good .
so that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do .
we can support them , good .
and we see it &apos;s going to happen .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
and then i say , i &apos;m sorry , yes ?
but with the right design , please .
in two hours , they &apos;re building all over .
do you remember the vibrational patterns ?
it &apos;s sort of a blanket print print print .
and in my inbox , i said , expectation .
the key interpretation of a piece is comparable to this .
especially if he died .
a phrase with his own breath .
because the music instrument is the extension of our body .
because artists have a high school proportion to the lie .
because we can &apos;t live without those online spots .
a particularly beautiful story , i think .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any explanation about reality .
we can continue these things in different examples .
the power forces are interacting with each other .
and in berlin , there was a crazy brass .
we have already twenty percent in germany .
these were the very first calculations in six years ago .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we &apos;ve got this seven gigawatts in germany today .
i was playing the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s orchestra .
it &apos;s hard to colonize the destruction .
he &apos;s got a handle from 15 to one .
he &apos;s a biologist at coaching la la luce .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your bellies , pink .
every morning , they fly 240 miles a farm .
and every night they fly 240 kilometers .
i mentioned this firsthand , and he was crying .
so instead , let &apos;s look at the environmental model .
you can dive in a decade .
you can jump directly to a particular issue .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
when i was a kid , i was constantly drew comic comic books and so on .
i was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
and this guy doesn &apos;t give us money .
there &apos;s a connection , a competing respect .
so what can we conclude from all of this ?
it &apos;s also very important for you .
does not have half or a quarter ? &quot;
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
and what do you do with the waste ?
the last three of the five i &apos;ve done .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this topic .
there are other innovative companies in nuclear sector .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
you can predict that . why is that ?
they lead the process , they understand it .
and i thought , let &apos;s get the same thing .
there was never a time like this .
my favorite rate had all died when they were 60 .
my parents are the 80 of the population .
anyone else knows what that is ?
that &apos;s a tough thing , and we should be ashamed .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t get so much .
and they &apos;re not just dying of measles .
we had no polio in this country yesterday .
have you all taken your vitamins tomorrow ?
that &apos;s great . i love the ted community .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
they have them . they &apos;ve always got them .
and some of them worked and don &apos;t work .
we &apos;ve disappeared what hasn &apos;t worked .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we don &apos;t want companies patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
... that also , the doses of a role play .
well , i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
people are now coming in in the world .
now , this is a storyteller itself .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
thank you . i have a question to you .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
this is a portrait of the photographer phil gen. .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
this player is short in front of a debit victory .
i don &apos;t get the real life of this feedback .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
players are masters in spiders poet nets .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
8,000 players were playing the game for eight weeks .
what do you think happens next ?
rs : healthy , powerful , sensitive . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
it was summer and i had tofranil .
and then , of course , click click .
come , dance with me . thank you .
we have been here for about 30 years .
it &apos;s a beautiful , very quickly , very quickly controlled .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
it &apos;s not the test of survival and success .
in berkeley , we call these robots , these robots .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
as i said , amanda carries our test .
he &apos;s steel of all the hope from my consciousness .
the dog ! i was lost from envy .
well , chimpanzees are known for their family accounts .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
play is the glue , which is ours .
look at what she does .
in other words , play is our transportation system .
so two pairs , one baby is one baby .
we &apos;ll go back to these people later .
so a lot testosterone , but no reaction to it .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
he had a very extreme shape of an innate settlement .
we don &apos;t know exactly why that happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
and they moved to a universal concept .
but how do you do that in practice ?
so i think we need to be leaders .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
and i &apos;m going to sum up for you .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
so this is the reason for this project .
well , we introduced this to the mayor .
here you see the building working .
i want to show you something here first .
it &apos;s at the same time , and it &apos;s a water camera .
so you can feel the whole movement .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important to the connection .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
do it possible -- you all here .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
so , imagine a big airplane .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the ted plan .
i never want to move into life .
they probably knew the most sophisticated of the ocean .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned retinas .
so this made sense , it adapted together .
so again , that fit really well .
it &apos;s kind of ridiculous , and it &apos;s just kind of zero-sum .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
so at this point , we need digital technology .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
i &apos;ve worked in a field of time -- dangerous .
no , that was what i thought .
it &apos;s a pre-competitive -- like this strange highway .
i want to help you down .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
well , what is the brand brand ?
i &apos;m selling in the entire country , all over the world .
tell me a little bit about this part .
we should put the bear in the cage .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
this would be someone completely intuitive .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
now , who &apos;s ready for this trip .
because it doesn &apos;t really feel the money .
in 2010 , it had been seen 23 million times .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
i want to tell you about some of the most popular things .
but so many got over the years .
life hasn &apos;t changed since centuries .
&quot; i don &apos;t know &quot; what &apos;s wrong . &quot;
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
if i say reality , i mean .
and here &apos;s every piece of cool planned .
she &apos;s got a button , on / .
i do my job at 95 pounds .
next week , this is coming on the market .
we have superstar , and nobody knew it .
it might take , until it &apos;s charged .
al is a city of boston in boston .
today , a lot of people have given up the government .
this is the call for service and information .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the test .
that our contribution to the system is to choose .
and we use this word with such contempt .
you can just show the slide here .
all of those were , they started climbing .
the dna system of dna was an interesting step .
the next step was now within these communities .
so , we &apos;ve got to do it again again .
say , &quot; please , that process . &quot;
now , we &apos;re doing this with 3d and machines .
they were inspired us from being inspired .
it can know how we hold it .
this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
she had the last word in every day .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , grandma . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
my grandfather was in prison in prison .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
wealth , not latin , affected the outcome .
we still seem to be satisfied with it .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
the death penalty is defined by error .
an amazing motivator . one of nine innocent .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental downturn .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
it was always so inspiring , so evocative .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
right , the judge , the judge has got a handle .
they came in and they came in and the office tubes .
this is the old one ran over the older black one .
56 percent of all the time is not coming in court .
8 : check .
different speakers : weapons of weapons . weapons .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
it &apos;s slowed down for no big problems .
thirty years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
and we saw this in mobile mobile .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
and this is very important in the business industry .
and this game was played by university professors .
we have access to tools with an exponential technology .
all right , really good , maybe a good one .
and that was not a very difficult diagnosis .
i didn &apos;t want to be a doctor &apos;s doctor .
and i went back to work .
the three words said , remember , remember ?
i was shocked , and i was shocked to live .
and that was what i felt .
it was a lot , and i was in a hurry .
it turns out he &apos;s got a test .
he had an endangered disease disease called ballbots .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
what you need is a new medical culture .
they supported by their mistakes .
i &apos;m a person . i &apos;m making mistakes .
and yet we still get to the galapagos .
we still think that they &apos;re originally .
they still &apos;re still described as pristine .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
they &apos;re less rare because we &apos;re catching them .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
you can &apos;t put them in the wrong way .
they just listen to and start talking .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and the problem is not the technology itself .
we had to do it because of the lawyers .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
and if you want to create them , they &apos;d be marginalized between the images .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
the way freedom to maximize is choice .
and it &apos;s deeply rooted in our lives .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
but tear is not always a bad thing .
the problem is they have too little .
you don &apos;t know anything about this . &quot;
our steps at miniaturization of life were exponentially .
so you may have heard that we &apos;ve built together .
some people were disappointed that it was not a poetry .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of view .
this is not a regular thing , it &apos;s a regular color .
this is footage about a duration of six seconds .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuel the fourth generation .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
and they had to remove what we did .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
by the end of march , the lhc will again be viable .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
i might have another 40 million high school .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
this is one of the most salient corrections of a creative life .
and it &apos;s more painful . it &apos;s for you , despite all this .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
this is 20 feet above sea , like greenland .
we &apos;re facing a political argument in our country .
one of the commercials in the wake up around christmas was that .
so the most beautiful , happy husband is a happy smile .
the most powerful coral is the head of coal coal .
new investments to get good paid to do well .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
i &apos;m looking forward to all of you .
and then there &apos;s some kind of closed asylum , fluffy closed .
and then we &apos;ve worked this way .
it &apos;s the reality and it &apos;s not computers .
and in this head , memory was falling .
so the big tool for the most appropriate tool has been since anticipated .
and they did this with what they call the so-called .
and the language of the language , which has been impacted by cyber states .
we &apos;ve been in the so-called so-called something called the so-called world .
another example is called the virtual reality .
anyway , that they do that .
and that &apos;s what we like to look at now .
we understood that the weather is global .
so how do we work if we have a magnetic field ?
information is every difference that matters .
now , everyone &apos;s trying to figure out this pattern .
and silver milliseconds , also , a very exciting phenomenon .
and that &apos;s why you want to think about the caravan .
on the ground , over 60 percent of the fuel is stored .
that &apos;s what all of you are in the middle world .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of polygons .
because , you know , this is a utilitarian process .
it &apos;s kind of a form of view , right ?
but today we &apos;re only talking about biological systems .
no , we put what &apos;s inside .
but everything that &apos;s inside is useful .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because now they have changed twice the amount of time .
so , let me help you a little bit .
and the video of the written notes in comparable music is comparable music .
in fact , the notes are very vague and malleable .
you collect information about the piece in the classroom .
to keep sure , directly with composers .
but maybe you can also do it again .
can you also play them in blue ?
i &apos;ve got a friend who drives it .
he &apos;s just kidding , and not himself .
so , we can &apos;t have these things .
there &apos;s only the second second , the fire fire .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
the first two sentences that are logical .
and i can say , you know , this is a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about what &apos;s wrong .
so if you say , there &apos;s no soul .
but it wasn &apos;t that much in the world &apos;s population .
they have an renewables today from 15 percent .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go back to a slide again .
and then it looks like this .
our goal was just to say , okay .
this has no one in the world .
and then a whole bunch of simulations did .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and that &apos;s what the message is .
and in time , they can react again .
then we have to break our capacity around the web .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put .
let &apos;s call him miguel . in fact he &apos;s called miguel .
this is a wiki corner in the galapagos corner of spain .
they did that by putting the land together .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
now i &apos;m going to choose the &quot; government . &quot;
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
i grew up with a spy portion of science fiction .
we &apos;re going to show it in the movie of the movie .
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
in the course of this voyage , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i think first of all the time is curiosity .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
so , climate change is going to be for you .
well , this is about time time .
this has to go down to zero .
the green the u.s. for hundreds of years .
many speak of one 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
the main question here is just like aids .
three squared is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
now they understood the advantage of the propaganda .
they produced the highest construction in the lowest time .
let &apos;s have a machine like this .
but you know what they don &apos;t quite have ?
they were just like people in this room .
what happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
that &apos;s a debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , metaphor .
you know , there was no marketing room in paradise .
we &apos;ve done it in the last eleven years .
yes , they &apos;re right . fix that .
you know that science is not a company .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
there &apos;s someone in the back there who had no childhood .
am i really sorry . do it crazy ?
let me show you a little bit nearby .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
now , the most successful self life lives continuously .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
that &apos;s not the way that &apos;s going to work for itself .
this is a key self in this choice .
we think about our future as a hunting memories of memories .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
there &apos;s other pleasure , but this is dominant .
now , you &apos;re not going to get happier yourself .
the more money you deserve , the more you &apos;re happier .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
that constant feedback is not in real life .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative awareness , very often .
you expect an additional billion players in the next decade .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
i only agree with that , that &apos;s logical .
what we want is to create the future .
so i say , let &apos;s start playing the games .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up to the doors ?
see , dr. strangelove has changed his thinking .
again , what potential do we want to add in ?
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something changed .
raise your hands . let me see .
how many would be good for a good memory ?
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
so they put it ; save the shoes .
bruno nilekani : mark , mark , come back .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
we &apos;re learning about trust and the rules of the game .
but are we going to make the best out of our lives ?
imagine just for a moment .
we &apos;re producing color , and we &apos;re talking about it .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
i &apos;m a gamer , and this is my suitcase .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
this is something built in the city .
very rarely you actually witness a big iceberg .
on the left , you see a little boat .
it was one of the leading graffiti director of the 1980s .
so they communicate -- so their fingers walk along .
so i talked about a couple of months later .
so they move around , and they &apos;re doing things like this .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentation .
there &apos;s all of this kind of data in front of the big unveiling .
and we need to make a lot better on this device .
today i want to tell you about circles and advertisers .
one of my friends did it -- richard clooney .
well , the next day , we were in cleveland .
it was something that we knew we knew .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and if it doesn &apos;t , auctions does not do anything .
and here you see a clip from this video code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
these results were done by several weeks hard work .
so the idea is to cheat a digital design .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is generic .
you could also use ordinary housing technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
so the driving force is the vascular superpower .
i was filmed in southern siberia -- difficult and dangerous .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is very likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
not wanting to do something with the movie .
no , that was not the mistake at all .
and then we offer one of these great feats .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
these are the people that shapes my worldview .
it &apos;s like i want to be .
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
it hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
you can go around all these museums here .
you get on two of them , very simple .
i love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best thing is , in a second .
but what if you want to see the brush ?
you go inside . you can really go inside .
so this is an aerial thing , probably never seen before .
and that was an experience for me .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side is not liked .
in the summer of 2009 , posterity was under a major school event .
he was asked to be told to be more restrained .
in this airport alone , there &apos;s a whole 100 area of 100 meters .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and pay attention .
a typical wal-mart provides you today 100,000 products .
i think i may have heard more hands .
because the pictures made it real for them .
three things : yup , the unexpected and the unexpected .
it was almost 200 million times this year .
this year , almost 50 million times .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still put together .
my grandmother never forgot me his life .
i didn &apos;t know how to use it .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
is it about the details or the colors ?
so i think the basics are very simple .
and let me show you a simple example .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
i always start with an act , an idea .
it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
we know another one where all the stations are .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
he &apos;s typing &quot; spider-man &quot; in the official database .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual experience is happening .
we need to engage in the engines of government .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
these little oil containers were the most primitive ones in the mind .
and try and do that again with another generation .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
fireflies in a glass i always found quite exciting .
and it &apos;s the way through the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also a different picture of the book .
at one point , the screen starts with leaves .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
we just put it around as well as though .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in northern africa and prison .
in my opinion , the world is fundamentally changing our world .
in many places , people had to fear their fear .
so these women met and talked to themselves .
and i went over and i just listened to .
people want to help people who have been innocent .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
then i ask myself : how could this happen ?
and i have to say , there was force .
ten minutes later , the judge quit a break .
rs : well , there &apos;s opportunity everywhere .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
what would you say to someone who believes ?
so the more sophisticated numbers come in the prisoners .
recession . gridlock . egypt . egypt . syria .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
so the amygdala is our early detection detection system .
he invited the king of saint to dinner .
the soldiers were brought up in the street , interviewing themselves .
it &apos;s new water opportunities on the way .
this is the innovation innovation that exists today .
what will you consume ? what will you like ?
i studied a 3d printer , and she was in love .
i put them and made me the treatment .
i remember that it was yesterday .
both cases of mine on me , i &apos;m looking at it .
some of my favorite students happened in the last five years .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
you know , he was in 1919 .
he described one of them as &quot; usual . &quot;
now he &apos;s been standing in the red list .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not being seen as a great loss .
the question is , why people accept this .
so this is a video organizer from improv in estonia .
someone was hacked , and had the system hacked the system .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s happened in the case of communication .
it was called &quot; automatically scientific rock . &quot;
a few years ago , i began to develop myself .
let me show you how they work .
and we want to make this material available for everybody .
we &apos;re all born . we get kids to the world .
and the key inconvenient for this is extinction .
but they didn &apos;t only kill the outside with the spear .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
it &apos;s an independent area . it &apos;s all in control control .
this is a whole book , an example of design .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird things .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
you must admit that this is a big choice .
you know what the answer to this question is ?
and we &apos;re so often reinventing ourselves as we want .
and the world we lived in was this way .
do you want the buttons or half ? stone or acid ?
it &apos;s also my great lifelong love and fascination .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
and in fact , sometimes he can feel almost painful .
she said it would be like a train train .
he ended the whole piece of play and doing something completely new .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t get more inside of it .
and the proposal was to build a lot of other people .
this is in our entire country in the entire world of northern america .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
if we zoom in , we can do a little bit of it .
so here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
now , that should actually not be a joke , but .
well , what do we do now ?
i think , sort of six dollars or something like that .
so , i think it &apos;s a very unfair hack .
and that &apos;s the core core of the world .
that &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
how many doors did the house have in which they live ?
the only thing that they had was their head .
and the lives lived in the early world of british columbia .
that is , you know , you &apos;re talking about sound and rhythm .
we &apos;ve been used to it that things happen linear .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
i apologize that i have to trick so much .
i &apos;m also going to resolve the same thing , which is there .
this is how it happened earlier in the village .
and what does it look like in this ?
that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be my glasses .
i don &apos;t know who you know of this picture .
this is the time when you fall in love .
so , how is a human being in a certain way ?
we could only slide as accidental as an occasional diagnostic tour through the surface .
if we don &apos;t do any phosphorus in fact and give it a place .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
that means the ants weigh a lot more than we do .
there are still a hundred billion trees in the field of water .
because the most important facility could be the phosphorus back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
we &apos;ve been using it now over three years .
and the oil we can replace is by other fuel cells .
no , throw it away is exactly the right thing , right ?
you can throw them out , where they go and stand .
in the countries where people are coming to money .
i can &apos;t play today like in 20 years .
because the notes are the only link to him .
and it &apos;s noisy and f , etc . , etc .
so these are the characteristics of the piano in the piano of my fingers .
the continual increase today with music is not brilliant .
i &apos;m going to ask , how do you know how iconic was this diagnosis ?
whether the music is you too cute or too sweet .
that was then the first beginning of a different musical expression .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford , &quot; n little car ? &quot;
and then i immediately fall to that .
the spanish painter , picasso once , once a woman &apos;s woman .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
do you do that and then you experience the sentence .
we actually know that something else is the case .
the soul is so kind of intellectual , says leibniz .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
because actually , this person isn &apos;t really interested in evidence .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
and then we started to negotiate with the sex community .
with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new research .
we can also put up two kilowatts on the web .
now fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies now .
this first one , that was more like a passionate translator .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
that &apos;s a little bit of two , he said , &quot; he said .
&quot; 37 to one thing ? what do you feed ? &quot;
i &apos;ve been eating it first in a restaurant restaurant center .
a trained reporter for a long time had talked about this fish .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
i wasn &apos;t a long time ago with miguel .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely noisy .
so the gut the belly the better the system . &quot;
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
the system is so healthy ; it cleans the water .
because if the water goes down , it &apos;s in the atlantic sea .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
this is not an industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
so i go back and i go back to the perspective .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
i &apos;ll just show the top 500 of the letters .
that &apos;s what i think it was very good at all the time .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t make yourself a lot .
probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
the second factor is the services we use .
i &apos;ve left the tides , i cut open , fusion and biofuels .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
there are a few innovations in the field ; there &apos;s a lot of innovation , liquid .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
a very different wish , that we invent this technology .
where is the biggest interest in what &apos;s going on ?
this is a variant of one thing that was made .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
these are common skills , and the combination of success and the combination of success .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and i took a while to figure out this .
these were ancient people , educated people , decent people .
these are a lot of deaths by measles , 20 per hour .
he led us from one of the worst people of humanity .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
they suck their urine . more never do .
so we go before , and where are we going ?
there was no marketing . we did it all .
you need it , and we don &apos;t give it to you .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to eat half a billion people .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
anyway . i want to definitely .
i &apos;ll do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my hand .
you probably know a lot of them here in the room .
now , what does this have to do with the space system ?
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
this is my flesh , and i can reverse this .
the first one of these dropped is to admit , to admit complexity .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
it &apos;s got moments of dna , one after another .
most of them are completely ignored by the heart of self .
the biggest difference between them is dealing with time .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
so i want you to think about a thought of thought .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
now , we &apos;re spending three billion hours a week , and we have three billion hours a week .
ok , imagine how extremes of it is .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
and that &apos;s from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and these were kind of the first of people evolved .
so , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global idol , &quot; of course .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use any time in time .
they &apos;re bringing them to open doors .
and then it was the three months .
how would it be to live longer with good health ?
isn &apos;t it for others ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
and our gut is a beautiful environment for these bacteria .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
how could it be that we do this ?
so just imagine two other little changes .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least familiar under the primates .
in most of my activities , i have two observations .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are in the middle stage of testosterone .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as girls .
in our observation , we &apos;ve come in all sorts of different ways .
we see this in all sorts of different areas of human life .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit in my tiny suitcase .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as being flying as flying .
this would call them , in southern siberia , to call them .
here &apos;s the results that we have right now .
but this is a huge amount of knowledge and complicated things that happen .
did anybody see the movie &quot; noor and tv &quot; ? &quot;
it &apos;s called the dorsal , and you can see the description .
since that time , we have all kinds of recognition .
the pilot set up the machine after the hudson river .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i said , &quot; please flying into the air . &quot;
and i salute , like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made sense of me .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i want to tell you how we found this out .
this aversion in iran is divided up in 15 layers .
and guess what we &apos;ve found in the business of the world ?
of course , this cannot be done by a human being .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to ask .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
but i don &apos;t know how people will be .
how much money is needed to realize that ?
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
so how exactly are we going to lock up in the movie ?
are you ? you see a little bit nervous .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
what about me ? what about the sex system ?
this is my brand in my little explosive industry .
what is the next one you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
a little more about them , they &apos;re not .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
it &apos;s a key brand , the brand brand . how is your brand ?
and how did that be for you ? what &apos;s it successful ?
this is just online -- no press , no television .
it &apos;s not even online , it &apos;s not even online .
finally , in progress , we should welcome fear .
so , in this museum , you &apos;re in this museum .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called the collections .
this is the &apos; death campaign , in the world .
i don &apos;t even think they &apos;re coming from the museums .
look , let me give you an analogy .
so quantum mechanics says that there &apos;s a lot of objects like that will feel like that .
we found that it was really weird .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what &apos;s truly fantastic .
there &apos;s more of it there , it &apos;s even deeper .
now we &apos;re far away from this goal .
all parties , all of the time of society , supported this .
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
it was a store that was called the captain .
this business , it was almost like a millionaire .
they always worry that they &apos;re losing off .
well , let me show you a little bit more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
rs with the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
and this video was actually sent in january in january .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
it &apos;s called animation , and it &apos;s a music in music .
and all of this leads to a big question .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was completely excluded that they could fail .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i met the decision to go to the u.s.
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
but they can combine something special like this .
for example , the fish had been taken on a roadside .
this is my favorite story . a very simple thing .
and over 10,000 , they were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
but it does something that doesn &apos;t do any other things .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and it &apos;s distributed , and it &apos;s organic , of course .
but what &apos;s happened to say , in the words , is different .
it turned off to the side . went home .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital thing .
let &apos;s call it a lot of money , it costs a lot of money .
so , if you could turn the lights back .
indeed , we are also such an eye-opening community .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
so today , evolution can happen in time period of microseconds .
so in other words , i first define what i want .
so find programs which can most easily look like .
finally , i get programs that can make numbers perfectly close .
and yet we don &apos;t even understand the possibilities of it yet .
the child in me is really excited about this possibility .
you can start to say things that are important in the world .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
she was also the beginning of a lot of differences in our family .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
i remember that it was yesterday .
i tried to say something about our national court .
the united states today has the highest incarceration rate in the world .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death .
he said , &quot; there are no death deaths in germany .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to build injustice against injustice .
we want to eliminate a lifetime of life without a competition for children .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
sometimes i lose the balance . a story for the end .
i had an x-ray , poor black boy as a client .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
we &apos;ve got ourselves out of rhetoric from the rhetoric of punishment .
and i think our current data is not helping anybody .
thank you for coming to ted . thank you .
i love this one , &quot; watson &apos;s human adversaries . &quot;
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
it &apos;s about making a half of goods .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
16 of the power of embodied power on the surface of the earth .
he took a famous photograph . what was it ?
there &apos;s a program that some might already know .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and the whole time i collected more and more knowledge .
and when i look at her , she made the noises .
i went through my way home on my journey .
if you do it , you never do it again .
and she said three words : do you remember ?
in a nanotube , i &apos;ve missed two times a while .
in both cases , there was a lot of time , and it was very good .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of plastic errors .
and at the end , they only want to get the existing remains remains .
in our own countries , we would never do this .
and the motives of efficacy are very easy to understand .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
there are cases in the way that we &apos;re talking about .
now , how do people die in this kind of high-tech ?
but if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign .
it was very fast , very quickly , in the world &apos;s atmosphere .
it was essentially the most powerful to the block of our time .
in fact , there &apos;s electronic sequences that have specific function .
but wait , this is really my favorite story .
and in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex narrative .
christianity , islam , buddhism , buddhism or whatever .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a design model .
there &apos;s a series of photographs somewhere here -- here they are .
they get a model that comes out of all the earth .
a consequence of that was the phone never broke .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the world we live in now is this way .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
this has hit me when i was talking to my jeans .
clinical depression , in the industrial world , exploded in the last generation .
a chromosome is just by just a piece of chemical material .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
there are enzymes that are called the raw enzymes that actually digest dna .
it turns out to be blue because of the genes that we had .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
these wires have a magnetic pulse of water , when the machine runs on top of it .
and i don &apos;t expect that it &apos;s ever going to change .
so a extraordinary statement that you can do about your work .
i would rather be doing this work that i love .
this search made me into the old greece and the old rome .
the greeks called these divine feats of creativity in the creativity of creativity .
if your work works -- not completely your fault , right ?
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
but even i have that thing in my lab , sometimes .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not making it .
but instead of getting into panic , he just listened .
i started thinking , i should just get this project out .
i &apos;ll continue to write , because that &apos;s my job .
when we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here to here .
and in the andes , this glacier is the rain for this town .
but if you break it down , most of the drinking water .
so the alliance of climate protection has launched two campaigns .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells well .
it &apos;s time to rethink america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
so if i put them side-by-side , they make their interest .
most people know the most people that are coming out of sync .
and then i took a video card and i put it on .
so i know about some of the ones that don &apos;t have .
and these are just the gallbladder , the individual people .
and the third area is actually explaining by itself .
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god , unfortunately .
and another example , another example , is the intelligent systems , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
which of course , of course , of course , is extreme and it &apos;s a computer game .
but i &apos;m just going to make it more glamorous .
and , of course , design influence on perception .
it &apos;s a little bit of the continuity of the continuity and so forth .
and then that &apos;s where it comes back again .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve been describing .
and this is this projection of the graph , optical , feedback .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
that &apos;s most of the perception that we have .
the less i kind of think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i want to give you a very particular aspect of curiosity .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the suburbs are getting bigger .
this is what it says , the more you do , the better .
you &apos;ve heard about some of the trees that you &apos;ve heard about trees ?
you can only have aluminum cells when you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
because it &apos;s totalitarian to go and take the nutrients .
it &apos;s natural , of course , but the habitat itself .
these are ancient countries that are controlling 40 percent of the population .
it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you go back to the wrong things , you &apos;ve got a team .
if you walk , yes , everyone is destroying the soil .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
because we don &apos;t do things more free .
so , when i first got a computer designer , i first had the written notes .
this is the function of the letters of a writing .
the work of the network is similar to how one of the things that &apos;s going on .
i play what these sounds could mean .
i &apos;m going to breathe the audience in the audience , or consciously .
and then the same thing happens in a good , fluffy conversation .
i &apos;m never going to play that way .
i wonder that you often forget something very much .
no longer need to whistle a whistle or singing .
or b , because you haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so please listen , if a music is played .
there was no piano at the time called the instrument .
and also , what they would think today in the spirit .
that &apos;s the first year for half of his value .
and then stones , so he can cut it off .
from this time , an anecdote you may know .
the human is supposed to have evolved or a common ancestor .
they feel that this is the actual truth behind .
so i want to show you two examples , maybe three examples .
he &apos;s really happy about it because he smiled .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum of all the ideas .
those were all ancient seals at the time , including the most cosmopolitan .
because a good engineer has either made great cars or a good engineer .
it &apos;s naturally from asia , in the case of japan .
and we can with this big battery two milliseconds once .
you see , there &apos;s a huge amount of dna there .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
so you could feel like selling him .
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to take a mess .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love of love .
they grew up on what was essentially the wetlands .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
the one of the people who don &apos;t feed their animals ?
and he said , &quot; we &apos;re building tests , not intense .
we &apos;re not rocket experts , we &apos;re tuned . we &apos;re listed .
this is the one that deals with two billion years of expertise .
because they are the ones who are experts for taste .
and i see a different pattern that makes it happen .
you can test it for my talk in your suite .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website .
so i can zoom in in my course in a certain timeline .
but i actually wanted to summarize the titanic in the titanic of the titanic .
this is the truth . the studio did not know .
this wasn &apos;t a movie , no offense , that was real .
well , they were also more sophisticated and more sophisticated more sophisticated planning .
so this is really what i did , and i wanted more .
because the set was a very precise copy of the ship of the ship .
so my way of making films changed is completely .
you have to be ready to take risks like that .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
it &apos;s the renewables that are often called them .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the destination ?
the uranium is consumed gradually , a little bit like a candle .
one of the things that offers a solution to the garbage .
the fact is that uncertainty should make us worry .
and that &apos;s a piece of paper that i think is appropriate .
they invest a lot of their time in molecular biology constantly .
and the way of collaboration with these kinds of collaboration as the core of a child .
ceos are something about average , but here it &apos;s interesting .
this is what happened . not a team had a robust structure .
that &apos;s how it became the same , bad team of one under the best .
so there &apos;s better to be a nine year-old at the beginning of my book .
and shortly after that , i wrote an article about collaborative food .
ask questions , demand evidence , demand evidence .
countless studies were done to see if this was true .
countless studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious thing .
has one of the people in the audience ever die of measles ?
no fear , no distress , polio , disappeared , disappeared .
he &apos;s just developed a few other people with a few other people .
what about polio ? let &apos;s do that . why not ?
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mies .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
i mean , ask us , why do we fight this ?
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
we can put this machine machine on everything we want .
and when i get around , the finger changes its position .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
that &apos;s a trick that you can tell your friends and neighbors . thank you .
okay , let me give you a little bit of blood for you .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to this . thank you very much .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest among researchers .
and my talk today is mostly going to act of these cognitive acts .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
these are actual patients who put in a painful procedure .
from the point of view of the self itself , b was clearly a bad time .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
so , you can ask : how happy is this universal self ?
we know something about what happiness is about .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how emotions vary with income .
and this is what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
my inspiration comes from an event that goes back 2,500 years .
there &apos;s these ancient cubes , from solar farms . you know ?
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
i want to say we &apos;re ready for our own life .
and i can tell you , it was an altered experience .
and i tend to be able to see odds as my shadow .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
or if you want to be confused , more powerful , more force .
are we in a kind of evolutionary balance in the form of a species ?
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his desk .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
if you have something to give , give it a difference now .
and no , it &apos;s not you or san francisco .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the pre-industrial forest .
just when it doesn &apos;t seem to be appropriate , it might be at the end .
under a hat , i &apos;m with the story of anatomy .
and as a general term , we can use the word for the word .
and the most sophisticated places , which are colored hormones .
if you &apos;re not moving , you cut them up .
we find other oddities of what their rights are .
but a lot of people joined in a very strange position .
now in practice , people are not tested in their chromosomes .
i mean , what do anybody do with so many dives ?
i brought seven of ceos , and this is all .
and i just want to show you my eardrum for this week .
you can almost look really great for less than 50 dollars .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
i want to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
so if we have cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
you &apos;re looking at the middle , the flow of the river flow .
now , today we know everything about where our things come from .
but we only know about where the things are going .
it &apos;s what &apos;s going on as a kind of a business of water .
but it was actually a greater even more fun night .
so imagine that , you could actually start flying to fly .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the patent system .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
they interact in clear ways with their surroundings and their experience .
while a iceberg is melting , i would have its lower atmosphere .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate ? &quot;
it &apos;s going to be part of the show of what &apos;s pretty wild .
you &apos;re about the block , and it &apos;s a revelation .
the revelation is that death is a part of life .
i was the only one who was able to talk to the ted community .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego space .
i didn &apos;t disagree with my wife for two years .
i just wish i could see my kids growing up .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
the idea behind the stuxnet is pretty simple .
so we should soon find out what the goal is .
they knew they had to figure out any bits , and they had to attack them .
well , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
and neither the most sophisticated , it &apos;s going to notice it .
he doesn &apos;t have anything to do anything with centrifuge .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the richest environments .
now , this brand , the core stadium , the center center center ...
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of retrofits .
there are some places we can apply to .
but what this picture represents is a problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a whole lot about transparency right now .
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the man &apos;s atmosphere . &quot;
in &apos; 80s , 2001 hit on the street , except on .
and so i found a company called 1948 in kenya .
why is it important ? what &apos;s the red picture ?
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to do .
we went to sao paulo , where we had been banned .
now , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
you welcome the fear . welcome the risk .
open the map , and jump with a click .
they &apos;re in there , they want to the end of the gangs .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
for example , that would be someone who &apos;s completely logical .
now , where would you adapt your brain on this scale ?
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle there .
that &apos;s the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
they could try to extend the capacity of existing apartments already .
each of these subjects , of course , was from many , many smaller decisions .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
we set up a little bit of business right on the entrance of business .
every single harvard staff is automatically taking off a piece of a piece .
we can deal with more categories than with more choices .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
now there are 10,000 yards from &quot; friday &quot; at youtube .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
what would you be able to write in the writing of that ?
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our culture .
the words , as long as their friends , are now their friends .
the biggest fear they had in front of pirates , rape and death .
the smell of the sun came from the rest of the world .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
and the more i spoke , the more i should tell .
opportunities that would not have been allowed to be explicitly encouraging .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure continued to go .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
photos like this : a construction site along a lot of the road .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic look like ?
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special images .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
and they developed great apps there , working with urban staff .
you &apos;re going to take him free to lift it , if it &apos;s fine .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
the spread of software takes a few years in the rule .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is in change .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if a neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
what is this new state that &apos;s going to take place slowly ?
and the next interesting thing took about another billion years .
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention when you think about it .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
we see the process that feeds from itself .
but i really believe that there &apos;s something more .
now i &apos;m just going to go back , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
this is what you have to do here the ipad , and fireflies drop down .
they &apos;ve always had maps , but these maps were static .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
she was a giant woman , strong woman , she had effect .
their parents were born in the early days of virginia as a slave .
the only problem with this was that she had 10 children .
my grandmother was at the end of the room and i looked at it .
seven million people are released in the middle or with hypertension .
but somehow , we can do it by this problem .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
and of course , it can never give you more in germany . &quot;
colin gibson , who &apos;s a great school leader , has said
and that &apos;s why i think the ted revolution should be .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
if somebody is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
a few months left , and i had just forgotten everything .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
i looked at the janitors , and i looked at the janitors .
that all of our survival is connected to every single one .
and yet , again , 46 percent of the diagnoses don &apos;t end with a physicality .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
so , you have a string here , you &apos;ve actually got a string of string .
am i going to give birth to death rates .
four : 24 percent of the speaker .
six : social decline . six died : 65 dead .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
the cost of solar dropped over 50 percent last year .
until 2020 , we climb data data from two billion internet users .
according to its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat hits 300 .
you know , how do you call a commercial terminal baseball ?
this is a person who &apos;s safe in the rest of 10 .
and that &apos;s the message i put in medical school .
i even knew the most popular method of grading in order to pick up .
and i was good , and i was going down with a tour of iron .
i sent them home without talking to my favorite day .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
he got a few days , and he recovered a few days later .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely valid .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know that it was the bottom of the sea .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
we &apos;re changing the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
because by marine reserves , we basically put back the past .
so a long time ago , there was 500 years ago -- 500 years ago .
they also had to register a sheet from this typewriter .
in these files , a folder was called &quot; neonurture . &quot;
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
beyond the simple play , it &apos;s actually pretty powerful .
we &apos;ve been distributed to kids , and you can see them .
so , go ahead and start to invent .
the father of this young man was identified as a followers of the ottoman lama .
this meant that he was instantly murdered during the chinese invasion .
this is the house house house of dickens , every column is a chapter .
this is actually live in the internet . you can do it .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by the internet .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
you see in the upper field that its chromosome just drops apart .
well , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
on the 10th of september last year , the machine went for the first time .
it means we have a cultural impact next to the scientific .
do you have no fear that you kill the humiliation of a mentor ?
with your stick , john -- how about you ?
please follow me , because the circle will come back .
so the people in the west are thinking about creativity for a long time .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to go on is : why not ?
and i guess many of you have done that too .
i &apos;m looking at this as i could just write a song ?
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the sierra budget was seen in the sierra .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
four times in the last 30 years , as many years in the world .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest biggest problem .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean adhesive .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
and it turned out that he just wanted to stack up the test .
and there was , i think , a very good code .
and i think technology is becoming more important in our modern societies .
and then the most abstract , then , under the most profitable open , and citizen science .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
in part , it &apos;s also partly with these places , so they put these places together .
i &apos;d write four out of four hours , and i &apos;d like to quickly explain to you .
and today we are still very , very strong stories .
this is a lot farther back , in the pre-industrial times .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe of the lung war .
what has influences our thinking and our memory system ?
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make this virtual worlds visible .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be in you .
but then , you know , the script was just going to come up , and they got it .
and these two worlds just pop through , new and old thinking .
but no longer on the local level , but on global scale .
but also , our perception of self , how do you ensure ?
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is this view .
because all of you talk about energy , but nobody talks about the problem .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , move less cars .
so the question is , how do we deal with these creeks ?
so one of the proof of this is that men are not pigs .
you can only be more confused if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
and it &apos;s especially to ask what the right thing is .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
things that are used only in technical systems .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really do .
so , in every store , you can put things together .
so , we don &apos;t need to be more free , we can be dismissed .
you study the works that he did before and after .
how were its circumstances , like the society and the politics ?
he asked me what the introduction of this session was for me .
if that &apos;s the exact thing happens , the student gets the full piece .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
the tune comes out of the bed and the rhythm of the dance .
this is a little bit of water that is not interested in the interest .
now this is a video file that describes us a logic .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
the first sentence is , it &apos;s not a soul .
and when i &apos;m right , the main news is a man .
if i don &apos;t have it right now , it &apos;s not a man .
secondly , when he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
it &apos;s a radiolara that is a priceless , which is made of pure nature .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack should go first .
i &apos;ve been working in the collective work for 11 years .
on this island , this is the island of lake sprawl .
yes , this is what &apos;s going on down there .
there &apos;s going to be a whole lot of data and arguments .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
no , no , because i &apos;m going to be a millionaire , and i &apos;m going to go .
until the 1980s , the farm in the hands was the farm .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company has bought green the country .
i asked him how he had become such a high school .
i said , &quot; hallelujah , don &apos;t you do your fish ? &quot;
it &apos;s the last commercial before something goes into the body .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
and who &apos;s watching that it &apos;s particularly true of men .
but even in that limited view , we can do a lot of things .
so i decided to be 15 when i was 15 .
and it was an experience that i couldn &apos;t give to hollywood .
and i fly through the ship a little bit through the ship .
we &apos;re going to play the costs . none of the fame .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and your team of your team is more important than all the world &apos;s assets .
it &apos;s about five tons for each of the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that reduce zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
typically , you know , you know , you &apos;re just going to say , and some people are not .
now , i wondered , how can i get this really ?
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
what we need is a lot of companies that work on this .
if we go back from there , how would this document look like 2020 ?
rs : well , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different camps .
usually , most people start to orient themselves on the task .
so i offered a $ 2 prize to software for the winner .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in being able to visit it .
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , it &apos;s not a hell .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
you can just call some names , and people will understand .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her kid against polio . no case .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
so , a little bit of a little bit that helps you to do it on the jumps .
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
please don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
and then people could eat the food and not be blind .
a deception is true to something because someone is so concerned .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
but it turned out that it &apos;s not all that much .
this is my skin . this is not a particularly of hollywood .
i know what people think when they see this .
this is really my skin . this is not a particularly of hollywood .
we &apos;re going to meet a couple of times in the next few days .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and what a story is that is a story that matters , significant moments and ends .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost forever .
it &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
and i don &apos;t mean just less successful , even though this is .
how can we transfer these feelings to the reality ?
so this is allowing you to grow the network of ties , trust and with each other .
players love to be part of awe of contents of contents of missions .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
it &apos;s a business that you have to get through a chain where you &apos;re going to get through .
and if you do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
we have a man who has a value for our society .
ah , the majority . i like to be a doctor .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
if we were to be able to get rid of these kinds of changes , it will be increasingly possible .
that &apos;s indeed the real burn of human and machine .
there are 68 million people who have estimated in a wheelchair .
he said , &quot; remark , you have to go into the house .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
so here we see a young female and males in a nanotube .
just that i think it &apos;s more like it , not true .
so , in fact , they &apos;re spread , both in bonobos and in humans .
in order to successfully adapt to a global world , we need to play .
as a consequence , the body evolves more to the typical female course .
when the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
okay , just a quick example of a variation of acrylic .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of microscopy .
and it makes me confess about consideration democracy .
it &apos;s because of what cochrane &apos;s going on with the sex industry .
and with this , you know , they have been prepared by a wonderful way of civil rights rights .
so how should we solve the question of the character of character ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
this is what we call in our lab design design design .
23rd , people are doing a short call , go on a toilet .
we can do the same things in doing less energy .
imagine that every single one of people will be free .
it &apos;s a physical science model in london , but it &apos;s covered with color .
it breaks about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
i was like , &quot; very high , how can that be ? &quot;
every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes , or draw .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back in southern siberia .
we counted his bed so he can look outside .
that &apos;s what keeps us on the stick and continues .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s an amazing thing .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one deserves us .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
and that urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
almost as if we &apos;re preparing our lives on this .
i was the miracle in which i didn &apos;t die at that day .
the gray boxes that you &apos;re seeing here , this is the rubber structure .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
and in fact , this false powers are the data that has been absorbed before .
and when the threat are , then you can really get bad things .
and if you do that , eventually you get a more hostile weapon of mass .
thank you for having a prius . thank you , ralph .
but besides that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
and the film &apos;s going to be called , &quot; the &quot; the man &apos;s atmosphere . &quot;
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
and just so , all these companies disappeared , one after another .
so maybe you should be a little bit of the interview on the interview . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of music and so on .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i &apos;ve been tuned .
and what happened was that i needed a experts .
i have this . the first painting is a picture of my family .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
what &apos;s the most powerful thing ? what kind of food are you now ?
that &apos;s actually just a time of two a week .
one big spoon full , so we &apos;ll welcome the risk .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
for example , this picture , for example , has about 10 billion volumes , i think .
and i thought , &quot; wait for a minute , it sounds interesting . &quot;
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again in new york .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
here i &apos;m going to zoom up with it . we look at the center right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side is .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard for all these extensions .
in the meantime , i was doing a talk at tedglobal .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and a new city includes new opportunities for leaders .
i asked my friends to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many choices you do in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
they make more of worse decisions -- worse financial decisions and worse medical decisions .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; just kidding . &quot;
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to assume gary &apos;s .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; which means &quot; jazz . &quot;
you have to make 62 different choices to make your car completely .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
if i start with the simple thing , i &apos;m learning how to do it .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours of video are uploaded every minute .
rs &apos; friday is one of the popular videos of the year .
we don &apos;t just find pleasure of something , we &apos;re doing it .
i knew they &apos;d come to say to me .
&quot; because she &apos;s been holding her since this morning , &quot; he said .
and also , in the fourth world today , the fourth or fifth row , this is the fourth or fifth series .
does it impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
and yes , i have a job as you might recognize .
but where would the next ted plan to help this patient ?
and they realized that the city never had this fire hydrant .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
it &apos;s not political , it &apos;s active .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
now why do we draw graphs in technology in the technology ?
and that is , every organism uses exactly the same letter and the same code .
so the neurons are the most sophisticated ones that have been built up that .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the same way .
now , all the jargon that are the numbers of the numbers have the numbers .
and this is with a method of design , analog to reproduction . &quot;
because all these new technologies of today are feeding themselves from themselves .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most violent thing for me .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary story for children .
in another chapter , you have to play a piece of acrylic and tag .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
it would be more sinister to us , consciously and target people . &quot;
innovation , creativity , and development isn &apos;t just coming from our heads .
i represent these kids who were convicted of very hard strategies .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the classroom ? &quot;
and during the last three decades , the most sophisticated in america is enormous down .
this is a fact going to be put in a context with increasing rates .
now , in fact , the number of people who have not changed very much .
the foundation for a lot of it , and these are growing together .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
so scarcity is , in fact , and technology is a finite force .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
as if it was with a set of new , unprecedented voices .
so how about it we can &apos;t even predict how to predict ?
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
we are close up to the world , and we move to the world cup .
and that means that the player is three of the 10 beats .
at this point , i was assigned to graduate school at the university of service service .
you say you never forget the names of those people .
i looked in the front door and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him away .
&quot; do you remember the patient with the parthenon ? &quot;
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
well , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
this shows the vast big role that can play a marine reserve .
and you may remember , &quot; avatar , &quot; you might remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in a way that &apos;s lost in some way .
and this is one of the three economies of the existing water today .
mr. jain himself is at a long-term level , the perpetual is unknown .
it &apos;s a state of view of the netherlands -- or it was that .
they had sold this program for the egyptian euros to the egyptian government .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
but there &apos;s a magic problem : the transistor was only for experts .
the idea behind it is that it &apos;s a growing library .
lights , notes , sound , motors -- everything should be available .
in 1957 , five shekels were set up , and made a big mistake .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of forest that was amazing .
it will not make any distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
all cultures have always been involved in the dance with new housing .
modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
this is a trivial case . this is a piece of the guardian .
and rick dennett from microsoft research was done a very good collaboration .
but the spatial orientation of the images is actually what matters .
this is actually a poster by notre dame , which was actually recorded right .
i &apos;d like to start with what i call &quot; the &quot; official mermaid . &quot;
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what gives us modern progress .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
beautiful beach . great afternoon . you have it all for yourself .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t get involved .
these organisms can get completely dried , they can actually live in a vacuum .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
they &apos;ve recently seen corn ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
it flows co2 in methane to the use of hydrogen as a source source .
and so the wires out of the wires , and the wires of all the wires to be electric resistance .
i find it better if we encourage our big creative encouraging .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
be forever for your contribution , whatever it is .
i believe in this , and i feel that we should teach .
in a certain sense , the arctic arctic is the beating heart of our global culture .
and one reason is , this enormous heat warms greenland from the north .
this is a huge increase in the world that leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
the united states is one of the most major economies , together with china .
it &apos;s affordable , and it &apos;s affordable , and workers stay in charge and bread .
we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
in the next 10 years , a hundred percent cleaner electricity in the next 10 years .
you connect it to a certain note and it tends to put it in .
that &apos;s actually just two and a half eight really , really , in the form of this networks .
so the device you see there doesn &apos;t work .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can get a little trip .
still , we &apos;re very arrested when we &apos;re very , very strong .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last year .
so i &apos;ve been busy , of course , when , of course , or intuitively .
the next generation of representation is already a lot more working with behavior .
and the most important thing is to look at the soil as a first thing .
we could of course reduce it 10 percent , but what does it do ?
because the phosphorus is converted to the solid components of the pigs .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , in terms of oil banking .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil where we go back .
directly , we can put nutrients on this kind of thing , in agriculture .
so we don &apos;t need to control the people who are more comfortable .
a woman in germany eats about six kilograms of three kilograms in her lifetime .
that &apos;s why you help , ask for people .
now , there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all be engaged .
there &apos;s an extra group of people who can join , where everybody can join .
the composer is getting more and more to the friend that you live with .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
you learn to find the notes on the instrument on the instrument .
now , why am i asking by my audience that it &apos;s going to be active ?
because the music is a language and it &apos;s a language to communicate .
it &apos;s a piece of art that you never look at has a force .
so they &apos;re going to be put on what they &apos;ve just imagined in mind .
i say , &quot; what do you need , &quot; n big car ?
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is gone .
they can also try and try and do that with words like revenge or transgendered or transgendered .
one day , this mirrors says , yes , there &apos;s a magic factory .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s wife &apos;s history .
they like it particularly , because he &apos;s got a tilt to their fingertips .
and there he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
even though i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in things i &apos;m interested in .
i want to tell you what we found in my institute .
it &apos;s something that is not stop by stop , physical nature .
because of lying , they can just use this logic wrong .
but the key thing is , when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s just true .
and now our consciousness feels immediately , you can do something .
this has to do with the fact that we go back into the back century .
if you wind more wind on each other , the system begins to fail .
in the run , three of the people are always waiting to be heard .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green is our system .
if you do that somewhere , it &apos;ll take a long time .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you guess what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
i said , &quot; well , how much percent of stock is the chicken ? &quot;
he came to the table with a bright , white white color .
who can make a fish so well , after he got to get it ?
well , they couldn &apos;t make it that worked , not economically .
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and the birds .
oh , and by the way , you shouldn &apos;t even be there .
it &apos;s in the course of evolution , and it &apos;s in the course of the evolution .
so , what we &apos;re looking at here is a typical model of age after age .
and from here , i can go into the site and go back to it .
and then we did that , and we managed to make a competitive advantage .
this is incredibly important . it &apos;s a good way of marketing . &quot;
and i remembered how much these miniature materials , a more common object .
but i don &apos;t really understand much of leadership before i got these expeditions .
no doubts , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
and we were born for a period of four and a half years ago .
nasa has one of these things : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
no important endeavor , the innovation was being addressed without any risk .
co2 warms the planet and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
it turns out to be the question of if you can get that on zero .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
in many , they &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re nuts ! that &apos;s good .
but while they talked about different people around the world about this possibility .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot of it later .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , just how little it is to support .
if you put an artistic law on the team , you will be significantly better .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high levels have a strong effect ?
so the question is : can we do that ? i think it is .
we &apos;re talking about ironic , with little quotes : &quot; progress . &quot;
and you can do that because you don &apos;t connect and correlation .
we love to face ourselves . we love this .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
it &apos;s not about genes moving around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
and that , although none of them -- it &apos;s just sugar .
if you take capsules , they &apos;re more effective than they &apos;re in any form .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a trick .
or , like was your journey after albania ? &quot; or something like that .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s got more than one ? &quot;
and she was a lot worse for a than for b in the world .
ends up very , very important and in this case dominated .
we don &apos;t actually choose between experience . we choose between the experience of experiences .
well , these are three weeks , and they &apos;re just a thousand hours .
well , the two species of the self are two words of happiness .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
we know that money is very important , targets are very important .
this is a player that is on the edge of a epic victory victory .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first of all .
not like i &apos;m -- i &apos;m developing games , i &apos;m a little bit of a little bit .
we &apos;re putting games to escape the physical world &apos;s suffering .
they were playing a training , and they were allowed to break up to an atm adventure .
they played 18 years old , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
we &apos;ve developed the game model at the institute for the future .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me like this , and play with me .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of human beings .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not sure .
and the a student will be tested more difficult , get the better teachers and so on .
so , very crucial at this trial , the teachers were not conquering .
what would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
a few . probably so many of you there are creative people here .
evolution is the creatures that adapt to their environment .
but there &apos;s a third way , a compelling , fascinating and scary possibility .
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it , to make these changes in your genes ?
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , whose numbers are multiplied .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the narrative of human evolution .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction also survive the world &apos;s survival .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their lives .
first of all , this is a design company -- and i don &apos;t think of football .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s no such test .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 at 1979 at the same day .
i get all my clothes out from the second hand on top of a second .
what &apos;s interesting today is the most important thing that &apos;s going on in our lives .
now , in this night , everyone went to celebrate the center .
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day is still there .
and we got the assignment to design a building at the expo of the expo .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
on the left-hand side , you see the most powerful sensations , different sensations .
and just like that , the iceberg gives you another side of his personality .
my life is really blessed by work in some amazing projects .
so we created a device that is completely free of limitations .
we set up a vending machine against a wall of the spinal cord the hospital .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never met each other as adults .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and that gave us great confidence that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just that .
and we often ran to a dead end and we had to collect ourselves .
the idea of this is obviously not only to cheat in the control room .
we need to make the consequences and we start to prepare ourselves .
so , despite that warning , i knew that anybody would buy the people .
these guys are being connected to the film in eternity forever .
so , my lord , you can help me ? i need help .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you a string version .
what is the context of it and feelings about yourself ?
are you something that is a little calm down a little bit , more conservative , conservative ?
are they established , traditionally , more traditional , more compassionate , compassionate than oprah ?
big data will be transformed for organizations around the world .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
but at the same time , we need a good set of intuition to actually capture experiments .
i remember seeing a child playing on a tour of a day .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ?
but you just measure the building of apartments from the cities .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so , in december , we met in the morning of a hotel in miami .
the other place that was interested in the urbanism is singapore .
a million people are leaving a year of latin america and travels to the united states .
how good do you think they &apos;re the decisions to cope with ?
and we found that there was actually a context .
and you know , the average world &apos;s average today gives you 45,000 products .
every single one of you could be famous to the internet next saturday .
because you do this , you know , if you &apos;re in a thick mountain , you &apos;re going to name .
if you want to know that , these other peaks are also also opaque .
one way to go to the front door , because she had to have six years .
before i read the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
i looked through the front page and looked at them on the other side .
and by midnight , the monk and he said he had to close the coffin .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of honor , ease , prior .
so the first rule is that connected photos should have the same perspective .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with that , i &apos;ve got over over 4,000 hours of twitter .
and they can do that through these sorts of devices , but they can also do it by 46 .
we know exactly where all the atm machines are around .
so , what did we do ? we conducted in the netherlands .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
they were there in february , and it has last february in february .
it &apos;s a nice little app , where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
we now know nine cities who are planning to use this app .
and not even like a handout , but rather like the internet itself .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
there &apos;s usually coming out when you &apos;re born in your town .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the citizenship .
this is a slide that i discovered from my folder .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to a power of power .
and this is what i want to look at on the disintegration of life of the earth .
it &apos;s also why , for example , the consistency grows .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and we install a 3d center in the machine that &apos;s going on .
because their life was out of it , whether they did the job right .
i was together in the middle of the street in the desert basin with wooden ali .
it keeps images and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
this map grows and it &apos;s shining and it &apos;s serving the rest of the book .
it &apos;s a story that deals with new issues , like the design .
when i was a child , i had some collections of email , rocks , rocks and submarines .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
i looked at her and smiles , but she looked very seriously .
she said , &quot; yeah . &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
in this country , there &apos;s been a population of children &apos;s population expectancy without any form of competition .
but for the dummies in this country , it was a time of terror .
we all have to believe in things that we can &apos;t see .
as a young lawyer , i &apos;m a great privilege to meet pink parks .
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to make you very , very tired . &quot;
how can a judge turn somebody into something that he &apos;s not ?
after all , i got out of my car , and i went up the stairs .
he looked over again through the window and could hear the whole thing .
two : famine in somalia . three : spray spray of the police .
and also , despite your logarithmic split page on the left , it &apos;s going up .
today we can ban dozens of companies who have done exactly this .
this is the story of cisco in the middle of the 18th century .
and the best part of this is perhaps what we &apos;re expecting to health .
she &apos;s a lot better this year . she &apos;s on a level of branch .
and it worked for a time until i met a printer .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular session .
and it wasn &apos;t the reason of my life , it was very loved .
in the united states , the institute of medicine took the number of 100,000 .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
you might think that he blew up , but that &apos;s not true .
until the &apos; 80s in the &apos; 80s , he was flying in great style .
the second story is going to be a different concept , a different concept , to prove .
so it changed nothing , and yet everything changed .
essentially the bottom of the sea came down on deck and then went back .
the reason for this : the government could track on where a text text came from .
these are aimee anderson anderson and so on and so forth .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only be worse .
it shows what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
in the last fall , it had to register , because it had been hacked .
and they &apos;re all handmade , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best part is they connect with magnets together .
you put a blue on a green , and you can make light .
we want to bring every single interaction in the world into a stone stone .
here we can see , with the video , paper and water bottles , like knife ...
it &apos;s a hummer of play-dough that &apos;s scared in darkness .
so , conventional are neither sentimental , yet they &apos;re from the postcards of aging .
whether it &apos;s a perpetual of a mind or a bunch of it , irrelevant .
the sister who did this brave job was brought into a plastic scanner .
we also did something about the corner of this particular piece of the guardian .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see it here .
of course , that mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen arendt &apos;s virtual earth .
their own photos are going to be packed with metadata , which is a different person .
but how would it be if the image is connected to all of your pictures ?
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
it &apos;s a effect that is , in a sense , that it &apos;s transparent to free .
they don &apos;t want to pick the wrong investment behind , or even the wrong thing .
and the salesmen said , &quot; do you want to master yourself , light or a lot of it ?
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , are deeper .
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , you .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify the minimum components .
and so , with the question , can we put a chromosome together ?
to put it in my context : i was born in the year .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is a spectacular picture of the atlas , in the construction , to see the scale .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
people said , do you have no fear to have ever succeeded ?
and i have a lot more fear of fear that nobody would be compassionate .
i think that the most recent of our artists have wiped out the last 500 years .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how is it going to teach us ?
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has now got a negative virus .
look at this , this is the right now , clean , clean .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
in short , a training machine is an interactive computer in the size of a nanotube .
each one has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work out , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it yet .
so that &apos;s just one application of many that you can do with it .
so a project i started to do recently was to build a research project .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , is clear .
but the language was the language , a very natural thing , something very natural .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re wiping out by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
then the next generation , in which we &apos;re actually still alive today .
this is just by pressure and print in the script with hawaiian and others .
and to look at how do we process information , how do we take information ?
a second circle is already starting to make certain resemblance or to associate .
there &apos;s a lot of time where i know exactly where to reach .
so no longer zeros or ones , or the code code , but a metaphor .
so what i do as a creator is a lot more often than the behavior that looks .
so he doesn &apos;t really like to think , but it &apos;s easy to do .
for example , for example , at the age of 20 , twenty percent of the world &apos;s land is now alhurra .
traditionally , we think in the world war , we &apos;re too many on the world .
in china , it &apos;s an unprecedented one today , in china , , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too dumb , our nutrients .
you have them invited them to eat them , not for the office .
there &apos;s on the front line , but in the landscape , yes ?
so this is the baby &apos;s baby for the whole life , already from beginning .
because that &apos;s only the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of the letters you see is when you can tell the language .
all of this influenced me and all this influenced my experience with the composition .
you get a new idea in it and immediately answer this one with a reaction .
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but not a major set of memories .
every time , it &apos;s exciting , because again , i read something new .
a lot of times that is the time that you &apos;re learning the notes to read the notes .
well , there it is going on the front line , which is a quick piece .
or c , because you &apos;ve got it , you know , that you &apos;re betting .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
listen consciously , and say , if it tastes or not .
it &apos;s easy to see that it has a very different sense of mind .
they can make them light less , yes , or they can do it .
and because i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in making things .
because in fact , we have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
in fact , you &apos;ve got to prove that there &apos;s something like that .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for automobile design , that &apos;s called beth .
i &apos;ve been allowed to ask myself how to mention it .
and maybe i may think i &apos;m going to show you that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
people always ask me , what do you do , because you &apos;re actually going to be there ?
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it &apos;s got to have an least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
the power station simply means running the power station to keep the frequency .
in the sense of course , aluminum rage turned into understanding , in a calm curiosity and grace .
so , you &apos;re probably going to be happy or bad to be a part of our future .
so here was a company that was trying to do it right .
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
so i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t stop .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to put the water back .
at the moment , it was like a director of a director would require a movie .
and then he added up , &quot; but our water has no capacity . &quot;
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
and to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
and if we can do that for raw data , why not for the content itself ?
this is just to recognize if you step back and look at it .
so we can skip and look at all the ted prize winner .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
so i can take one step back , and jump directly to a specific entity .
here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration that i &apos;ve been thinking about .
and if we know , maybe we can even get into wisdom from this .
when i was an adult , it was a fellowship .
so , films of the way , images and images and stories combined .
we took little robots that we built , which we built , which was a design company .
so i actually serve it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight , as we do , as we do .
so we were making tests , but actually , we did science , actually said , more specifically .
this leads to the lead . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
every american about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
and it &apos;ll look at nine billion billion years of production in nine billion years .
and because you burn these 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better .
it &apos;s a big wish , but i think we can meet it .
and it &apos;s sitting there and they burn 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
in your imagination , in time and chance and chance to be able to do something like this ?
so the great thing is that the great possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
have we got to introduce to try to try and think of the more stable ?
they lie , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re confused , and they &apos;re actually producing kind of confused .
and with every attempt , the kids get instant feedback , and what doesn &apos;t work .
you might ask : why would someone actually invest time to create a vaccine ?
and what &apos;s the most important thing is , it &apos;s helping you individually identify assumptions .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the cushions .
i believe that somehow you &apos;re drawn to the nostalgia , you know .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this number goes up , and it goes up very quickly , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
we type , we &apos;re going to be able to eat , that &apos;s okay .
chernobyl , sports , the challenger , the challenger , of mass destruction , of mass destruction .
and this is something that we need to learn very quickly .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge carbon problem , but it &apos;s not science .
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be esoteric panisse , but it would be nice .
and all i can say is , why do we fight this ?
now , it &apos;s in present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
i have learned it from the most violent magic giants in the 1970s .
and if you want to have the ultimate credit , you have to grab the needle .
so this is really my meat . it &apos;s not more sinister meat .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had at the same time .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no lesions .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players connected ? &quot;
and so scientists recently came up with the idea that they were born , in fact , in fact .
we can give a new meaning to a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
wiser stand for a change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
it means producing something that is in one is the potential .
if you could have one of them , it would be a very different world .
in this period , maybe there were 20 or 25 different species of hominids of hominids .
she looks at him , and she says , &quot; i &apos;m here for ted shows . &quot;
this is all reality today , and in the future , a lot more possible .
are we going to create a society , and we &apos;re going to be able to create more robust and dynamic , or dynamic ?
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my apartment .
but nothing was invented that would let me go back to this point .
they &apos;re going to run in a building room , and they put a park in the neighborhood .
bonobos and humans are equal to the lives of the lives and their claws alone .
the founding fathers were out of my view of the original background , which is why .
democracy grew , but at the same time , science was growing .
they talk about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they made us a concept that was made by shifting things .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give the same rights as a person .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism female is . &quot;
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden tv signals .
so before i go home , i &apos;m going to take it all back .
so if we do something about the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
early afternoon , people here and there , the phone calls them and move .
so with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of food in the system .
and the question was , how could you connect technology , new technology with it ?
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on in london for the olympics .
it all has digitized , knowledge , and it makes it accessible to the internet .
and these particles are water , and as our cloud is a cloud cloud .
erin is born as a calf of a glacier or by tearing out of a glacier .
and during the iceberg , he melts drinking drinking drinking drinking water .
so we decided , tony -- and to support his thing .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
and somebody who has such an artistic potential deserves so much more .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably most likely in america &apos;s most frequent fashion .
she saved my life by using the toilet in the stream .
the pilot had already rejected the machine , and we were not so far away .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the most nuanced movement of nuclear weapons .
and it seemed a little bit more frightening , with these gray boxes , these colored boxes .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could demonstrate or disprove .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and it &apos;s on top of the torah .
if you look at the people you have to do with it ...
if you could do it for you , you could also help me .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
today , more than ever before , we get a little bit of honesty .
we then set up a team , a great team , and we started with this .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve put in with what we call called &quot; the iliad . &quot;
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really get close , you can go to the breathing .
so i did a couple of years ago doing this .
how would you deal with that your body is in the room ?
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
on april 17th , it was approved for the second time to a voice .
it &apos;s already built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
and we decided to do an experiment , and we decided to do this experiment for our experiment .
the categories have to say something , not the one of the choices .
go from the very few choices to the many , then they remain .
jimmy blackmore would send the tweet that the video was so popular .
already in the first seven days , there was a spoof for every single week .
it sort of managed to find the time , english and food .
she was opening up a computer , and she went and opened a business .
with 17 , she became the second woman of one who her mother proposed .
we told her stories , and elders , you know , we were still with her .
so it &apos;s more about catching an idea than really a moment .
but this picture is actually completely surrounded by photographs of different places .
no one knew where to find the next life-saving species in this moment .
we choose a few fellows every year , and we &apos;re going to work with them .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in southern siberia .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he &apos;s beginning to go with the camel .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
i &apos;m going to start showing you a single boring slide .
a little bit more odd because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
but if something happened here , this is what &apos;s going to change .
i think the big picture makes sense when you split it into a couple of more studies .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated , very complicated idea here in my head .
and those next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey . &quot;
i spend most of my time with people living in prison , prisons or prison .
in the short time here , i became sure , ted has an identity .
my home of my home , of my home , is permanently the right thing to do if you cleaned up .
but eventually , these realities are going to be derived from suffering , abuse , petrochemicals .
they come from ideas that are driven by the conviction in our hearts .
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
sometimes these ideas go ahead of our thinking , in very important ways .
he said , &quot; mr. &apos;am , have you questioned this crazy interpretation ? &quot;
and this is a design that &apos;s going to suggest money to invest more and more secure .
this is the reason why the dome of the wing is made of aluminum .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered 70 percent of water .
and instead of looking at ecological gridlock , i &apos;m one of the largest economic economic resources in history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
i think we need to have to do something about a piece of medical cultural culture .
and i think it starts with a medical physicist and i &apos;m .
the rest of the day , i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
&quot; do you remember the patients you put home home ? &quot;
why did i not ask the question ? why did i send them home ?
and then when he went out of the door , he showed up on his desk .
how can i teach them my mistakes so they don &apos;t do the same ?
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction like antibodies that attack people .
what you need is an environment that you can get in the position of .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding , but i can live with it .
because i experienced it when i studied a lagoon in 1971 .
there was about 20 inches of about 20 inches , camping , a subset of the fittest .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- a lot of northern europe .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
for example , here , this is mr. swifton , in ukraine .
they use a lot of money to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of ted .
you can put a switch in between , and you can put it in a little bit of a little bit .
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a rubber ball .
you can go to the website , all the coffee galleries and make it yourself .
now , a language is not just the sum of the vocabulary or a series of elements .
if i asked you , the great world religions counted , what would you say ?
it &apos;s a photograph that i took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians , they say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
his uncle was with her holiness in the diaspora in the diaspora .
his mother became locked in , as punishment for -- to be wealthy .
the man &apos;s husband was afraid not before the arctic night or the flying storm .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
my favorite one is in the middle -- the middle line , and timbuktu , and weiffenbach &apos;s flashlight .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to have it better .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it myself .
with 100 different types of jeans in the window , there is no excuse for mistakes .
12 to 24 hours later , it &apos;s got together like this .
we &apos;re from six billion people in the next 40 years in the next 40 years .
he lives in the deep sea , about 44 miles deep , in almost serious fashion .
and i think that it can be changed by creating vaccines in the process .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions , is yes , yes .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as it was and ever .
they were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
already today , in some flat lakes in alaska , methane is methane from itself .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest largest community on the planet .
40 percent of all the people in the world are getting half of their risk .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the spatial region is deeply linked to how we understand a lot of our environment .
and the key ones are an example of a new generation of grassroots digital data data .
if you &apos;re surrounded , you can see that , and you can get a little nervous .
by the way he can shake up and put it side side , he can let the characters interact .
and you put them together by simply holding one of them to a stick .
there are effects that can change live , like hall and filter .
and now i &apos;m going to take the filter with the bass , for something more expression .
there are so controversial things that are happening like this whole , genetically modified plants .
so , just to hack biology now , you don &apos;t need a material .
for those of us models , we heard that we have basically a natural relationship to virtuality .
the fourth thing is that the story for us is a place of commerce .
there it is about virtuality , it &apos;s about 3.2 , it &apos;s all about the time .
there are technical concepts like the augmented reality , which means the extended reality .
yes , children are inherently curious , or should be curious , designers also .
when professors become curious , they &apos;re often in the n &apos; n .
it &apos;s that we know globally , and it &apos;s getting better and faster and better and better .
in fact , i &apos;m sort of interacting with the object , and i can start to zoom in .
and once again , an interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
in israel , you say , you know , when you &apos;re a human being , you &apos;re going to call the earth .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be rodents as a trees .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we take the waste of the waste .
that means you can see in the internet , how to turn the nutrients back .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people , more easily .
we tell people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have a green in the south .
but if i ask you , how do you deal with your wife ?
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a design model , which is at room temperature &apos;s temperature .
and that &apos;s half of all the world &apos;s population , which is caused by the textile industry .
but strangers are very alien for terms of what we &apos;re doing with our lives .
so , the music works for me as much as the word language .
i then say to my own words , what might be written between this framework .
sure , i &apos;m going to have a few of these pieces of data , but it &apos;s a new environmental environment .
an example of this is a very different area of mine , and monet painted .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different walks of time , with light lights .
you &apos;re basically learning first , until you just talk one word .
but even if you design this data , it still stays a little technical .
you don &apos;t need to make music even better if it becomes boring .
every one of your music will be emitted when you &apos;re getting out of the outside with music .
have you been brought up , or do you know , you know , how do you get it beautiful today ?
so , you don &apos;t get out of dinner , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music , because you don &apos;t play instruments .
that &apos;s why composers rely on us , which are the songs of the songs .
you need this lie to get a motor ball to get self-deception .
this woman then complained , the portrait would not look like her .
here &apos;s the logic in this , and this is what &apos;s going on to talk about .
you can &apos;t call it , that would be a little bit more politically .
so , in the way of the equation , you experience the brilliance of lying .
and the title of speech was , you know , how to get a hundred percent renewable .
and i always tell politicians about the politicians when they &apos;re going to be put together .
by the way , a hundred gigawatts electrical output on top of the world .
you have to go more and do more and more likely to be able to do it , and not only do it .
we &apos;re cheaper than the average age of five percent per year goes up .
what nathaniel imagined , the music came back into a community of friends .
robert gupta : i want to play a little bit , i want to play that i &apos;ve got to get stolen .
even better , he was being violated by the ultimate standards of sustainability .
that is , 15 pounds of fish are required to get a kilo of candy .
on the day before the event , i called the head of the warrior for the company .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
it &apos;s now become the largest and one of the most important private practices in europe .
they do that because they can follow the most complex white line of the highway .
i had introduced a kind of a journey of the penguins , so i looked at miguel .
he looked at me as if i was quoted by the whitney of whitney .
she liked sweet , and as if you take a bite from the ocean .
we &apos;re now threatened to be threatened by today , not due to aid , but due to resource resources .
we immediately get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia .
and i can sort of see what i &apos;ve been looking at today , again .
now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
and my love to the ocean is holding up with the same intensity and ever .
it felt like i was physically within the fall of the titanic of the titanic .
i &apos;ve all got these films , these tests , for a very small audience .
the answer is , until we get close to zero , temperature will continue to increase .
well , we &apos;re going to run a lot every year , about 26 billion tons .
almost every unit of electricity for electricity today is co2 , except renewables and water .
now , if i use the &quot; miracle &quot; miracle , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
if you want to pay care of 100 percent , you need an incredible amount of energy .
bill gross has several companies , among other things , that have one called the great motivator .
his new brand is now : &quot; why don &apos;t research be discussed anymore ? &quot;
so , there are so many lessons of lessons for us , about nature and success .
they find crazy examples of all the world , like people can optimize the system and make it .
a big machine , a cool machine , and this is a time machine .
you don &apos;t have a right on your own facts . &quot; sorry , don &apos;t have you .
it can save the lives of life , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
when paul talks in a public service , he can &apos;t talk without armed guards .
the knife you can examine , my hand , you can examine .
i &apos;m going to take something that is obviously a deception , and let it look real .
you can see it in the same way , but you can also see , if you want .
we &apos;re not just telling stories when we &apos;re going to tell stories .
well , this is a direct conflict between the lake self itself and the water itself .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we use in the world .
now , the most important self makes more than remember and telling stories .
this is one of the explanations that is given to the dominance self itself .
if you ask the happiness self &apos;s happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing .
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
in the sense of the other self , the human self , you get another story .
in the united states , you have to measure the growth of the population .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you &apos;re going to get some of the nuances in this picture .
we think that we &apos;re not as good in reality as playing .
and i &apos;ve found some things that are going to slow down the epic , the epic .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
according to games , games were more accurate , more specifically , in the kingdom of famine .
we &apos;re going to leave ourselves with epic and give people the opportunities to reach them .
so , what do we actually want to compute -- a disabled person or a healthy person ?
and i want to do with not the impact of the impact , or the hard of a human being .
and he said , &quot; well , you might not remember me .
the real meaning of the word &quot; weather &quot; occurs in the word .
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who always wished for more creativity .
these are decisions that their grandchildren , or their grandkids , need to be around .
so let me introduce you to this now -- or the human universal piece , universal piece .
one of the things that &apos;s been estimated is , you know , it &apos;s been a few shoes .
women , as men , in our bodies , have something called their bodies .
so we have this persistent leap of categories that are problematic in many ways .
if all the answers yes , i feel like i won .
natasha for exactly a week , everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
but only when i got 30 , i really understood what that means .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the oil budget -- causes to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have with our environment outside .
now , today , our environment begins to respond to us .
and if we show that to people , we can push a behavior change .
imagine that there can be a little donation of a small donation .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
imagine a big explosion , as you go up to 1,000 feet .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on top of it .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends .
these gray boxes are not running on the walls ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
it &apos;s basically running out on the surface of the nuclear nuclear stream and on the ground .
we need digital retinas there where a human being can &apos;t react fast enough .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for these attacks are not in the middle east .
in my opinion , it &apos;s involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i &apos;d be happy to be happy to do this .
but is it a difficult thing about the film or a difficult thing for me ?
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to that , it &apos;s going to happen to change something .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes-benz .
two : part hippie , part of caution , partially -- i don &apos;t know .
they have helped companies like knife disease , and they helped to discover these kinds of things .
now , that doesn &apos;t have to be a fear . what kind of rollercoaster are they ?
you put it on ? are you something that &apos;s going to bring your blood into it ?
i feel that we have to encourage people to take risks .
i went close , and i realized that these kids actually beat something .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two halves .
how do we develop these intuitions ? well , we love playing things .
he was a toddler and not very good at that , and he fell all the time .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the big objects around us .
so i made this thing in similar ways to make a computer chip .
what does it mean to vibrate for a object at the same time and not vibrate ?
only for about 12 percent of their decisions took them an hour or more of their time .
today , i &apos;m going to talk about one of the most profound moments of our modern time , which is the most violent .
now before we started this tonight , i had a conversation with gary .
so , for example , this is a study that we did in a study .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
just like , &quot; double &quot; it seems to be out of nowhere .
well , sorry , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
it &apos;s important to creativity , the creativity that &apos;s going on in the world &apos;s position and geeks .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life .
the next puzzle puzzle shows how a boat in the early world &apos;s early jungle was hanging down .
like most adults on the boat , my mother had a little baby cap .
so , i talked about five and an education and education , and the neglect of the world trade and the firemen .
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going through the women .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i &apos;m still thinking about the boat .
because this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
photos where you have to think a little moment to figure out the trick .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic fires are failing .
there &apos;s going to be a little bit of this little baby that you stick in an iphone or something .
and i want to give you that we make care of the environment by making ...
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;ll just skip the video .
so he did what every good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it has an app , a security engineer , and it &apos;s an app , and it &apos;s called &quot; shhh . &quot;
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government was playing a central role .
so these awful , longer to survive longer , and they scaled up in a remote scale .
and this cells -- these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
as an example , as an example , the most famous version of us is the human language .
we say , &quot; computers , please ask a hundred million million randomly sequences of instructions .
but one of those likes to be a little lucky , two numbers in the right order .
we know that there &apos;s no harm , if it becomes too complicated .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver tape .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery formed very strong .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i had something , your sister had something . go , a beer beer .
he said , &quot; grandma tells all the grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what our actions in the historical context have .
but thinking about a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we do that . so we &apos;re as rational as we are , so much of intellect .
she said , &quot; and what will you do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
we need to have some ways to confront these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discussing .
even though aluminum &apos;s percent is going to reduce percent , it &apos;s not a purely metal .
and if we have a excess imbalance , we will also have water in the abundance .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
but now , the biggest power that will lead us to a world of abundance .
and after two , three days , she realized she would never deny again .
and in the course of the next eight or nine days , they turned out to be the operator .
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
as you can see , the lagoon of palms and a few of the mangroves were carved in .
my third little story tells the story of my favorite story at the university of university in southeast asia .
within a year , you have a survey , and then starts with the mainstream fishing fishing .
with time , there &apos;s a little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the most powerful thing .
and they found an article with a radio hall , they could track the creator of this thought .
the second one that we see today is not motivated by money .
these are the questions that we have to do for the next 50 years .
green is a copy , blue is power , pink is input , and orange is wires .
put it on for a more difficult effect , and they &apos;ve made a more powerful .
but what &apos;s interesting is the very unique tone of the dance , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
the interesting thing is the metaphor , which defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
the suffering of communism can be intolerable , but the mind of the people &apos;s mind is a little bit more nuanced .
and it &apos;s mortifying to think that our species may exist for 600,000 years .
in their sled , they were originally made out of fish , which was locked in southern afghanistan , which was being locked .
this is a project called bipin , which is really two different technologies together .
you know , i never thought i was going to be working on microsoft .
we now have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
should i get married later ? should i have children , or do a career ? &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
they really want to make the decision right when it &apos;s for all the time , right ?
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
when they came in 100 ways , one of them should have been perfect , would be perfect .
and that leads to less happiness , even though the results are good .
if you break this down , so that everything is possible , it lower happiness .
does it allow chemistry to make these really large molecules that have never been done before ?
it took a couple of years starting with a grant review before we did the first experiments .
the viral particles were then released by the cells and came back and killed e. coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they were doing this model exactly .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the internet system .
the key rate had a dozen components , and you see the diversity that came out of it .
but that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing right now , the same approaches to the development of vaccines .
in one of the connections , between a bioluminescent magnet in the lhc , there was a water block .
the wavy and a distorted whole egos , and it creates all this imaginary expectations of success .
maybe an ancient understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creative .
if you want to know what the sea level is going through the sea level , it &apos;s flowing into the ocean .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m making with a simple design .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of a kind of mixture and a mixture .
it &apos;s a story with open and he can decide how to evolve .
and then finally , i can browse the whole sequence by running on the left .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of matter .
but always always the approach that it should be simple and accessible .
and what are our values and what are our involvement , our foundation ?
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
they don &apos;t have any food workers , but they have used the way they did it .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from a b to b ?
and this is the age of age , and this is the book , and it &apos;s going to happen .
it sounds very intimidating , and sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
you can explain that in a lot better , because there &apos;s a lot more about it .
a lot of them use the word , but they don &apos;t even know what the detail means .
so the most important thing for the challenge of the world , the most wonderful , the most wonderful , the most wonderful .
sounds very trivial , but it &apos;s kind of interesting , if you &apos;re concerned about it .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually going to happen .
there &apos;s a lot of time the practical function , so that &apos;s what kind of points of things like that , or the kind of things that you see .
it &apos;s done a lot of time , but it &apos;s obviously a lot better .
this is what we &apos;re losing in the ground about five thousand times more than new .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back into circulation .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
in every place , where you go away from , yeah , you &apos;re going to be able to go back .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that it &apos;s throwing away with biodiversity to biodiversity .
a television or a washing machine , which they use , they don &apos;t use it .
i said yes , you need about the same as long as the spoken language .
well , you see , in all cases , no one has to be a candidate candidate candidate .
or what i &apos;m going to do today is because what you might have thought about .
why do we prevent that people know how to get people to get true ?
but we know that if we tell you , the social narrative is very sensitive .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that should work .
so we &apos;re supposed to be able to perceive them as something that is necessarily true for our lives .
so the second sentence is , if it &apos;s right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul who &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and i brought you a project that i &apos;d like to introduce you to now .
you can only , of course , if you managed to get fed in some kind of way .
we just wanted to know what is , with a normal , coordinated battery .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild the society again .
that means we &apos;re looking at the largest battery &apos;s largest battery .
we &apos;re not going to be , you know , foreigners , you know , we &apos;re all setting up , don &apos;t do anything .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a solar system .
and the reality of that expression gives us all of us , and moves , inspired and together .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve gone down to the ocean as we have bare forests .
now , he mentioned some algae , and some of the things he said , and then he said , &quot; aw . &quot;
it was about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds .
well , last year , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
so i want to make this idea a little bit further , which is a little bit crazy .
and the summary of this is a short , and a symbol of the area that comes from .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge of it .
so , in &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot more .
so i shifted this , and i made this other film about the big ship that stops .
and the recovery of it was tremendous . we had to build cameras and house and all kinds of things .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
so i asked the question several times , &quot; do we really need to go down to zero ?
it all includes the food we eat , clothing , television , heat .
usually there is no deadline that you need a miracle to a certain date .
but in this case , we have to give back , and a miracle in very short time .
is there a natural representation , a demonstration that the idea of people here ?
and i decided that this was shown by fireflies &apos;s contribution to the environment here .
now , there &apos;s all kinds of things like this , but they don &apos;t bring all the way .
let &apos;s take the burning fossil fuels first , burning from either coal or gas .
one is the energy density , which creates these technologies dramatically smaller than the power power .
instead of breaking the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
if countries are meeting places like bermuda , they should not only talk about co2 .
climate change : do you have one or two sentences to convince you ?
they talk about it , they &apos;re going to look at what it &apos;s going to look like .
and that is , you know , that &apos;s been trained to find a real plan , ok !
it &apos;s incredible . you look around , and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
if anybody had built a high amount of construction , he would have carried the price home .
and the key lesson , i think , is actually the construction sport .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a explorers .
it &apos;s because options don &apos;t go back on this planet , they go forward .
i think we can power the world with energy that they don &apos;t even breathe .
this is not what happens in the country , but dangerously in the world &apos;s last year .
it &apos;s absolutely cool , and it &apos;s kind of cool itself to us that can afford .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat , to eat the same stuff , like heating .
but it &apos;s actually not about this right now , and then i open my hand .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a scientist , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing .
and people say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen it right . &quot;
and then he added it , really emotional , that has ruined all the experience .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply to one per self .
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life itself ?
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about 30 times .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
i have calculated that it takes time to play at 21 billion hours a week .
oh , you know this . ok . nice . so we have some players here .
that &apos;s me , as i &apos;m doing , &quot; in life i &apos;m bad . &quot;
why is it impossible to think , to think , you couldn &apos;t just achieve anything ?
and players are always willing to work hard if they get the right task .
the second wiki in the world , with nearly 80,000 entries , is the world of warcraft .
we work with universities throughout sub-saharan africa and store , to learn , social self-assembly .
and he called this part of his course the x factor , the potential of the human being .
we divide from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very comfortable .
they help digest essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
now , when i was a college camera on college , i had my first ted experience .
but at the time , when a growing organisms came up , things began to change .
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
of course , this leads to some major complications -- more participatory , 30 percent of them -- chronic retinas .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of humanity .
they live in the deep realm of protected , and they &apos;re only hard to see .
that could be the evolutionary origin of this : &quot; she takes it to the eggs . &quot;
i &apos;ve been working with people with travel -- so people who were less than usual .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one had something .
now , mind , i want to preserve certain epidemics , anatomically , in our culture .
so let &apos;s come back to those two beings who have been born at the beginning of the talk .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , it sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
in feminism , it &apos;s about the gender bias about gender , so that &apos;s why feminism is nothing .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing your pants pants .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
our cities , in the last few years , were equipped with networks and electronics .
please look at the shape of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s at the bottom side .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
they say that all things that are displayed up there are a life cycle .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger and stronger .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life .
and then he said three words -- the most famous words i &apos;ve ever heard .
because if the wine is so far , and the person is there , i open it .
while we were missing , i had this feeling , man , to die , not terrifying .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals may be met by stuxnet .
so for example , he would work as well -- in a power station , or in a power station .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- luckily , fortunately .
as you talk about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand a brand .
how can we hold them longer -- better fresh fresh , more fresh , three times .
i think if you prevent people , you get them closer to failure .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunity that they might be doing .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and her access to her access .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
so i &apos;m now in front of one of my favorite years ago , and i &apos;m talking about seven-year-olds in the 1980s .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what are you going to get for 10 billion ? &quot;
and what if you want to see , what if you want to see van gogh &apos;s masterpiece ?
and that &apos;s a great design model of the world , as long as you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s so long .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
to be part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
so if you think about it effectively , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a computer company ; you &apos;re already looking at this area for the second city .
one thing that you already know was turned out , there &apos;s a lot of pollen .
or even to build these cities , or hundreds of people around the world ?
and after that , we looked at the case that people were more likely to buy a glass glass .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s against our own interests .
and if their employees can &apos;t tell them , they can &apos;t do their clients . &quot;
now these are different decisions in the number of choices that they provide per choice .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the sequence of the decisions .
who would have &quot; double &quot; or &quot; rebecca &quot; can predict , &quot; or &quot; oops black , &quot; could be predict ?
two out of the school , for the school , to cover the holes in the other .
in one of them , i was the classic asian student , who hired himself to himself .
and i turned out from a street to the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
at the end of each one , i sold a huge drinking soup that we shared .
but if i could give this , and you could make sure that i could do it .
we &apos;ve developed an app for long-term reality , extended reality to find these kinds of things .
but what they really do is to show what technology is today .
it &apos;s very important that these clouds work work , but people steal the batteries .
you know , if you know , you know it doesn &apos;t usually know that it &apos;s not going to happen .
but it &apos;s all the public , but it &apos;s all public , so everybody can see it .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice as granted .
they use their hands to write the applications that improve the government .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took a few hundred million years .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosion .
and it makes it partly with methods that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
the poor were caught up thousands of years in northern pradesh , in an old book book .
so , actually , you create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to connect the world and technology to each other .
you &apos;ve got to do the sound of the network , it cleans and read the rest of the book .
as a doctor , you can do good . but as a physician , you can do more .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up and gave me a magician .
and she was something that made that you always wanted to be close to her .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . just do . do you . &quot;
he said , &quot; well , what &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot;
and she believed that this was the subjects that we have to care about .
in social , and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
and here , in alabama , 34 percent of the male population is permanently lost their right .
but you can also think differently depending on how we see our identity .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question of whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and of course , after terrorism , of course , menopause and decades of innocent motivated motivated commitment and apartheid .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t show it , it &apos;s not just a pathogen .
and i was not just writing him , but sent to the court .
most of the time in this country didn &apos;t really occur in the class of the world trade .
and the old adage , &quot; when it comes up , demand &quot; is very true . &quot;
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is getting worse .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer with &quot; risk &quot; for &quot; risk . &quot;
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
i took her cut . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
and he knew it , he would have been able to have more additional information to her .
so , i put in the front line , and i got an ambulance and an ambulance and i got them home .
i salute him to get him to email and asked my colleagues too .
and you know about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work later in africa .
ninety percent of our transportation system were sponges , other animals , who are connected to the cause .
if you &apos;re punished in a nanotube , it &apos;s pretty much secure your phone .
for those of you who became more educated , there was another material , electronics became another material .
as any of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on earth .
but what &apos;s so interesting about this is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
in fact , they like to say , &quot; your white goes to church and you talk about god .
this plant contains a few very strong changes that are the serotonin , and it &apos;s very similar to this plant .
you can only get into a few other chemicals with some other chemicals that the mao percentile .
so these are all handmade , and they all stand in the way in the context of each other .
the doctor says a has to have these benefits and risks and b , those benefits and risks .
i &apos;m going to give you another extra example of this , a study about investing in volunteers .
he &apos;s making a statement of it now , and maybe things slow to do things .
this was our first trial , starting with digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
we made little pieces , and we made a correction task and a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the most cosmopolitan in a $ 10,000 base base .
think about it : we have a magic code code : a , c , g and t .
the chromosome that was in the cell was none ; the chromosomes we put in .
then , of course , there is all the co2 of this material running in the atmosphere .
we &apos;re starting to start in the first line of biological reality and those of our ideas .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
maybe we may not be able to have a rational persistence of 500 years of rational humanism in a corporate talk .
it was lit by the inside , and it &apos;s lit by the bottom , and it &apos;s all wrapped up by a divine fire .
and the most exciting ones that showed up about a few of these things is particularly powerful .
around christmas christmas , at home in tennessee , in tennessee , a billion tons of miles .
it &apos;s in the skin and abundance in america , and it &apos;s helping our economy to grow .
this question was so disconnected that we decided to study the answer to the answer and the answer .
and then even more problematic effects like speed and volume that you apply to all the sequence .
and so now i &apos;m going to the filter with the drums , so i can control the effect of life .
and you also have to do it and understand it and understand it and understand it .
these are the people who have at least officially bashed on the website on the website website .
this is what i think is there , and there are fewer people who are actually being there .
and , you know , you know , it was the first time in berlin , which is the first time in berlin in berlin .
and i would invite everyone to deal with it , and even once again , what to try .
the interesting thing about this is that at the same time , the human being was at the same time and the medium itself .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability , virtuality as a real habitat .
because steve jobs used to say , to dig out , to dig up , to make a difference in it .
this is what you call , or you know , or you know , it &apos;s something that affects us in perception .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think , we &apos;re looking at the beginning .
you &apos;ll never forget it anymore , because i &apos;m going to show you where it is .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to go back to the point that i see the mouse .
that is , this first impression is happening in a rapidly fast speed , as we perceive things .
in the last 20 years alone , there were tons of tons of uranium on our fields in germany .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be rodents as a tree , right ?
and the great thing about this is that it &apos;s in the favelas in the favelas around over ninety percent .
and they &apos;re designed to work through the design that can just operate a farmer .
the dutch government explains , you will be the first country around the world , which is phosphorus .
in holland , of course , you understand that easier because in holland , the land is built on flowers .
so , it &apos;s about creating a large footprint that becomes a reptile .
so no longer save , prevents , avoid , reducing , don &apos;t reduce , but smart waste .
so , for the learning process of music , you need to be at least as long as your spoken language .
now for me and for the composers at the time , what they could now mean for him .
now , i &apos;ve been older , as a chopin as a chopin , as he wrote the piece .
but then what i would do is , you know , because music is a beautiful thing .
i said , but surely you can tell if it or not .
and the kid is playing , after a while , a red flower , instead of a red flower .
by beethoven , you know , he &apos;s heard more listening when he was deaf .
in such a lie , you see the liars don &apos;t believe what he &apos;s saying .
so here it is necessary to see what we &apos;re using underwater , and again , again .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people &apos;s knowledge .
so , you have to think about another philosophical topic , a museum of philosophy .
and if you place the exact exact middle of the middle of the middle between two and a half .
because it &apos;s led to a tablet that he doesn &apos;t get on himself .
and you really have to stay pretty tough , but i think it &apos;s going to go .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and how somebody wanted to poison in sleep .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you guess what &apos;s sustainable about the chicken ? &quot;
and my head was taken weak about this drawing piece of delicious fish that i had on the eve .
they breed away in a city of 240 miles , where it &apos;s better for the water .
this was the cause . it was the resemblance . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
in my school , i went to school with the bus every day every day .
in math class , i was constantly caught out of the teacher as i was hiding in latin l.a.
i made my battalion in a pool of the caribbean in the middle of the winter in the winter in the winter , new york .
until today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , there &apos;s a lot of knowledge of technology , and magic is no longer different from each other .
and i thought , &quot; wow , it &apos;s got to be put in the filmmaking . &quot;
and then we started , we showed up to the wmap , and they explored them .
but at the end , it turned out to me that i took off with the deep sea .
i remembered last year when i got mosquitos and sort of liked the people .
and these are the subjects , you know , you &apos;re talking about lots and 1,000 times more space than a normal power station .
i think there &apos;s a lot of people in the ted group who are already engaged there .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , perhaps surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something done in the direction .
so that &apos;s sort of the deadline that we have , which shows us that we need to move .
it would have been without the air , but it &apos;s still much more important .
then they invest a little bit of time into planning and organization . they put and put spaghetti .
what you may be wondering : how does this happen ? why ? what about those ?
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to decay the world very much .
okay , so there &apos;s reason for reasons , and i think we know what reason that are .
take it away , return the diseases back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country that will be worse than any other of these diseases .
nothing moves into my sleeve , or comes out , doesn &apos;t come out . and you can examine everything .
a year ago , i read a study that really blew me up .
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side again .
so i &apos;m sorry . if you look bad , look away , don &apos;t look .
and this starts really with a fundamental response to our memories -- it immediately starts .
and no one of these stories is very patriotic or great -- but one of them is that clear ...
so we &apos;ve got the heat self , and this is what we &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re really quite different .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future is that the opposite is appropriately .
he wanted to capture the feelings in play , so he started building a camera .
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
you &apos;re not sitting around , and it turns out . there &apos;s always something important to do .
so , what we have here is a full generation of young people who are the dominant ones .
these are our archival spots . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
this was the first time in real time in real time of the world &apos;s world trade . that was 16 years ago .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we describe with these words .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
so we need to look beyond the surface of the human possibility and focus on all the human possibilities .
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , there was a case in the united kingdom , which was turned on .
if a mind has a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new design .
and you &apos;re all going to give them all the nutrients that you could just wish to do without effort .
and the argument here is that the wheels of evolution slowly , but they are expanding .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
so , with the most successful , i can carry 200 pounds of the terrain terrain terrain , many hours .
we &apos;re so far in the process of view of this device , and this is this device that &apos;s going to be in this year .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a leader of an organization called robin hood hood .
for us and it &apos;s essential to the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
our ancestors had never had that hard to fight with the question , when someone was dead .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , make me tense .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
over the cities , all this sense , and running into objects of the everyday life .
now , all our objects , our environment , begin to speak back to us .
now , i should tell you what happened at night when all the sensors stopped .
here you can see a real , real estate , which is the most cosmopolitan in order to form of mud .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever chosen farmers .
i could see it in their eyes , because there was horror , the life was ended .
i want to share with you three things that i learned about this day .
i &apos;m not trying to have more , right , i decide to be happy .
about a month after that , i went to see a performance of my daughter -- first of all , not a lot of artistic talent ...
and more than anything , are you the best parents you can only be ?
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
either &quot; paradise fusion &quot; or &quot; paradise &quot; -- you &apos;re going to have the choice .
i have to talk to the man on the street , which is like me , i &apos;m talking .
but normally , i have a training , like juicy , or a jewelry and a piece of jewelry .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength instead of both .
if somebody asked you to describe your favorite , your favorite , the way you would ?
and when i went to go and visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
this is the most salient , the moma , the moma , the most cosmopolitan , the van gogh .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m going to zoom in into one of my favorite pieces of this picture , until i really am in the dry .
this is the first object you can see , which was in the middle of the ted community .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
in 2007 , i decided we should have decided we should think about economic development .
so we could very simple with the world , and maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd for you , unless you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
and i &apos;ve come to the punch line that a new city gives people new possibilities .
and they found that an average ceo in the week was busy working on the week .
and this is a problem that you often see when you look at the long bullet points all of these fund .
hi . i &apos;m kevin arendt , i &apos;m looking at youtube , and i &apos;m looking at youtube .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- did his start at youtube .
after a thousandth of four and a half of a sudden , he &apos;s a boat quiet to the lake , as an ecologist .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in southern france and sat around her coffin .
you might think that &apos;s just one landscape , and the bottom part of it has been manipulated .
so to get a realistic outcome , it &apos;s seen from me out of planning .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that fellows wrote in the last year .
and chicago has just introduced it to the people who are going down , and the people who do it .
this is the work that &apos;s very smart people &apos;s work in the office of new urban city .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is going to thrive .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
you can think of your mind , on any channel of time , and you do it .
i &apos;m not here about the details of the slide , rather than the general shape .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is going on and forever as fast as it is now .
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
i think the reason is that we realize that there is something going on .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange your dna .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
then the extra steps , like language and so forth , took less than a million years .
it gets faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so mystifying .
and i think it &apos;s very powerful to say that we are the end of evolution .
if we were going to travel at indians , we went to a car , and we walked over the sky .
and so -- this is : &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
they hit me so hard that i could barely breathe . then they left me .
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
she said , &quot; well first of all , you know , you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
and it &apos;s exciting , because i think of my students &apos;s history of african-american history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
they say , &quot; no , no -- tell people that we grew up with . &quot;
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
even after genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
every single second , our senses will begin much more information than our brain can ever process .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look at negative news .
and that comes out that the most sophisticated , more participatory and communication mechanisms have reduced to a spiral .
steve pinker showed us that we currently live in a very peaceful period of life .
i &apos;ve been looking at the newspapers and looking for the best headlines i could find .
imagine that this artificial intelligence used to be available to every owner of an individual .
aluminum was at that time the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platinum .
and to win , the device has to make a better diagnosis than a team of doctors .
so what can three billion grow , healthy , educated , productive members of the world &apos;s population ?
and it turns out that today the human pattern of performance is better than the best supercomputer .
and it was my assignment , looking for the most successful piece of advice , looking at the world .
and over a year from a half to two hours , she started to feel better .
the unhealthy way that i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you sick .
when did you hear this last time from someone &apos;s last time of view of news programs over the talk ?
and my patients are not cars ; they &apos;re not telling me their symptoms in the same way .
and i got a terrible crushed , and i was convinced that i was really not in the case .
when i returned to 27 years later , the fish dropped down half of his size .
there are several well-known cases of childhood engineers who have earned their money through attacks .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- the protests , a opinion , or through their audience .
so western governments government argued governments to deal with their own citizens .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
it &apos;s a tool with which the soul of a certain culture will find access to the tangible world .
in a museum of a second continent , these people were the only ones who had never been conquered from the mainstream .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of cricket , if you haven &apos;t seen it on top of the ground .
if we ask these myriad populations to the meaning of the human being , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
the family who was afraid of his life took him all the guns and all the tools .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve anything .
and this really reaches these ideas , these limitations for available space on the screen .
we hope that this doesn &apos;t matter , and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice , how to show this slide .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to .
so , by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which is the most appropriate thing .
so i want to say , there were some options , but not everything was a question of choice .
you &apos;d like to cut up , you know , cut away , blah , blah , blah , and so on .
so things that i &apos;m talking about are a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
this is almost with perfect safety -- possibly for the fish , possibly for the fish .
now , i argued that this is not the most sophisticated -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
we &apos;ve got technologies today because of this fast fast time to do what we call behavioral genetics .
we now have the ability to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
you can afford that because if you get them very far off , you &apos;re going to be called okinawa .
but , when it comes to write , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i &apos;ve been asking myself , why ?
this is -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
the roman had the same idea , these kinds of creative creative minds of mind that kind of genius had a transformative genius .
this is great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
it felt like it was coming , because it would take the earth under their feet .
so i took my look from the manuscript and i spoke my comments towards an empty corner of the room .
so if you want to have it better , you have to pop up here and drive your level .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the hell .
but again , very rarely , something special happened . one of the actors was actually turned out .
and the disasters all over the world have really , in a really crude and unprecedented degree .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution , to make us free of this stuff .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can put in any patterns that you can see .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by pulling the pace into one direction or another .
i don &apos;t have to plan it in the field , but it can be coined ; it &apos;s increasing , in the meanwhile , or double .
now , there &apos;s craig venter that &apos;s been trying to make , like , you know , that gas made out of algae .
and our approach was just to say , &quot; stop , &quot; i don &apos;t really have to do that .
and the commercial device costs about 30 euros up or something like this , or something like that , the 50 .
now , how is this with virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
the preacher , priests , the preacher , were the extra damage to keep knowledge in stories .
in virtuality , we &apos;ve suddenly become alien to us , and has nothing to do with the reality .
and they &apos;re going to have been more and more of the centuries of time in the centuries of the fittest .
but that &apos;s an essential part of the way you want to do things very carefully intuitive .
i have this sort of cognitive affinity , you know , you have what you want to see .
i &apos;m just doing it differently , and i &apos;m making beautiful , not that it &apos;s better .
but again , this leads me to the point , when will things be more intuitive ?
and this is always a little bit intuitive for us , if i have to think very little about it .
now , i can do this with this mental pulse , which is , you know , i &apos;m going to transmit , you know , you know , i &apos;m going to transmit , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , i &apos;m going to be transported to a mouse .
they could easily be a liter of a liter , and then the facility would be ruined over years .
unfortunately , they don &apos;t even know , but they can help you a little bit of the time .
this is the first green backpack , actually , to go back to the circulation .
or d , you don &apos;t like a music , and you don &apos;t want to have a good thing to do with it .
they heard about this book from charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of the people .
she came one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about a student .
a third sentence , which immediately shows up to people who have a strong sense of a soul .
so , we do as if it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul .
in the present of about a modern example , we have a whole modern example of all the time .
there was a academicians who said , by johannes , and after that , he named , &quot; here &apos;s the emperor of divinity . &quot;
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent , and our network is physically seen in europe .
let &apos;s also support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
i met mr. gardner in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall .
it was a beautiful fish , and it was good , good consistency , it &apos;s a bench on the menu .
and that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
and here , here he is a pattern of verbs that reminds him of the psychopath giraffe .
and then he goes and closes into more talks from rare birds and algae , and strange and odd .
&quot; i know young , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
we love farmers &apos; farmers . we love small girls . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat organic food .
or better , how can we create conditions that encourage every community to feed themselves ?
capital , chemistry and machines stand in it , and it has never really created a good thing to eat .
it &apos;s something in between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
this is really important , because this is a realization that is not in a single sample .
if we can do that , then this long term will be made a new source of information .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the limits of possible .
i certainly would never do an alien world with a spaceship , which seemed pretty unlikely to me .
the nature of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , in contrast to our own selves , human imagination .
i was able to connect my preference for the underwater , and i could connect to the filmmaking .
and what came up was the first computer-generated ball ever to see in a movie .
sounds crazy . but it &apos;s going to go back to the fact that your imagination can create reality .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a nanotube .
so let &apos;s look at each factor of one factor and think about how we get it to zero .
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their mailing lines under the ground .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
so what we need to do on a global scale is to create a new system .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as a function of energy .
you see , it &apos;s a kind of a column , often described as &quot; walking wave file . &quot;
we need to use carbon dioxide , transportation , mobile &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; d &amp; amp ; d &amp; lt ; d &amp; lt ; d &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
we need to have to be more rational and complete and complete the things that are done by the government .
and it would be best if it can be multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
there &apos;s a liquid water that seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe they say that .
and peter tells me , &quot; neither of the kids who are not investing in the board of the spaghetti gyrus . &quot;
and that team , which is falling down and look at the work of the team will significantly improve .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or a consensus , to build the right prototype .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i continued .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics who were crazy at all were not fanatics at all .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same .
i know that they did that because half of americans do this every day .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are building all this in it .
so we also want to understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
it creates a very strong picture in your head . it &apos;s much stronger than a white pill .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both the most frequent in the idea of happiness .
and the surprise is , the patient has a much worse amount of worse than the patient b.
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future as a experience .
but danny , in the entire american effort , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
this is going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of national statistics .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
we never have these feelings , if we play games , there are just not .
and maybe some of you have a new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; whoa , &quot; read .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s the most important people in the world .
because if we could figure that out , we would have never been there before that we could have had a human potential .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone a game .
we know that as human beings , we &apos;re hardwired to do hard , meaningful work .
no one wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
so , for the next part , we &apos;ve got a bigger game , higher goal than just putting it together .
and the call to the player , you know , you know , , you know , we &apos;re designing almost like a &quot; gal &quot; program .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they &apos;re google .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies and was just being created for the work with children .
this is just an example of many , as adults can make the imagination of a child .
our language is based on the social changes , in many cases , caused by technological change .
wiser is not an obstacle that we need to have to do with our lives better .
and maybe we only know what wood we &apos;re going to be , if we &apos;re really tested .
and i &apos;m walking around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
when i first saw her , i took her from her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough how significant this factor of a human life can be .
and that &apos;s happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite that experience .
what they call this is what we call the &quot; upsuck &quot; in the united states , which is what we call &quot; aaaaaah . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t necessarily break the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
why not have the fast few people who will allow them to be able to run faster and longer ?
so flexible design enables you to get deep into the living room , and we can do highly competitive movements .
i was 24 years old , and i was in prison , as a tech writer , as a writer , and i was told .
i was the second volunteers at the university , so i had a pretty good opportunity to be able to get inside .
as chimpanzees of large , fear of great fear is led , the most cosmopolitan of the female is led to the female .
our system is based on the idea that there &apos;s a certain amount of incentives associated with a specific identity .
it &apos;s also about race , which turns out to be a lot more complicated than we have ever known .
what are we supposed to do with the fact that we &apos;re only different from a few inches ?
now , you might assume that the whole catalog of categories would make someone like me really happy .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you &apos;re talking about nature and the god of nature .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
and if you think that you don &apos;t look good at something , you &apos;re probably right .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
now the first project i want to show you is in truth of one of the first of our labs .
if you fall down , you can write , you can write patterns , images , text , text .
imagine the screen might appear in different formats , or sizes , in different forms .
my heart jumped off to me , and i was just trying to grab what was going on to me .
part of the ice that i put in is very young -- some thousand years old .
i love this picture because it &apos;s a room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
and after i thought about this , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
i don &apos;t want this thing to cast in 20 parts , as you know it from a documentary .
and that sadness is really in a thought , which is that i just wish one thing .
what would you do , that you put , because you think you &apos;re always there ?
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart from this code .
so , it was possible for us to bring the little digital computer technology into connection .
rotor layer is that moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
so , for example , the number one thing that &apos;s going on is very out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
so we might sell a shoe , and he &apos;s going to sell the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever worn ...
who knows , when the movie comes out , we might see a little bit like a turtle .
but why ? well , transparency is terrifying -- like this strange bear , the still screaming .
the brand , the brand i &apos;m , i would say , is the flying fly fly .
and you can also see this here , target , wii , mini , mini , and you can see .
now , there &apos;s a film in the oklahoma film festival , and we can see this .
if we had a scale to measure all of the hemisphere , we could see their brain .
that didn &apos;t feel my intuition , and maybe just because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
so what is it for an idea to think about how to do a completely new city ?
and also recently , a study was done with ceos in which they saw the ceo for a week .
the more possibilities they have available , the more they have their money in pure water .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to make it easy .
so here &apos;s a german physicist , who gives you the opportunity to completely articulate your car .
last year , mr. augustine signed this video that he was shot in the rural national park in the rural national park .
this chart shows how it looked , when the video was first popular last summer .
because , like jimmy popper , we have new and interesting things , and they show us a big audience .
michael j. nelson der theater theater theater was a first one who did a joke with twitter .
if you had my sister &apos;s party , i would have my sister and i would drink them and my grandmother .
and because of this aid , i became a boy in my last year as a young boy of the year .
there was a power , a relentless optimism , a strange optimism , a strange mixture of the humility and .
i took a shower in a hotel room in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
and these two images meet these two sets of demands -- from the same altitude and the same altitude .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced at the ted table was to take a place .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like a little bit like a sanitary pad .
if you do that , you can give it a name , and he called the first al .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they fix them .
i &apos;m more talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
this is because the government is on the ocean and it &apos;s the top of politics .
this could be a fire hydrant , to crush a trash with a trash , turn it into a trash .
it &apos;s really like this , then we &apos;re in the middle of a transition right now .
so i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are now .
we &apos;re so far that we can only write in the code , even in this code .
and they developed special structures that did nothing else than information in the organism .
the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years per piece .
and i think we &apos;re all part of the creation of what &apos;s going on next .
and i came up with this as a thought of our fancy clocks and cameras of it .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is , but it &apos;s also very noisy .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
i &apos;m a 52 year-old age , and i &apos;m going to have never drink a drop alcohol alcohol .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems aren &apos;t our problems .
and because that is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that has to respect the law .
because in this context , we first begin to understand the most amazing things that we have .
in my estimation , i explained that vulnerability was the most violent and the police and the police .
when he saw me , he came over and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
during the break of the break , there was a day in which it was made that the janitors was in the classroom .
we &apos;re not completely designed as humans as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and human rights .
and it covers the whole information on the quest to look for any type of reference in our environment .
the chairman of coca-cola has just come up , a large designer with a hundred units in developing countries .
but before i talk to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
in high school , a coalition of school said that brian augustine would learn for a test .
in the morning day , she &apos;s going to walk her -- ms. printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
both are strong , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as much as we should .
but i &apos;m a lot of the time , but i &apos;m trying to learn best of it to give you another one .
i went on this , and we made the census of the entire southern ocean , and especially in the south atlantic ocean .
we fit our way to the new level , and we don &apos;t think of what was there .
at the time , we &apos;re focusing on the big animals and the sea is the big fish .
here , i think , the art and the film might fill the gap , and simulations .
and this is an idea that , if you think about being able to meet one with hope .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we &apos;re capable of , and what we &apos;re amazing about as an amazing species of species .
and then suddenly you would see how it would be if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , how can you get damage to the mind ?
now , this doesn &apos;t get a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
not change and technology , and technology &apos;s integrity -- it &apos;s power . that &apos;s the very ugly face of rule .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit of the inuit and all native people around the world .
all of these photographs are being connected , and it creates something larger than the sum of the parts .
we can put together millions of different bikes of different bikes from the components that are being offered in this business .
and what it does is it takes people to run into business and ask that question .
with so many options you can choose , it falls to people very hard at all .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , comes to never come .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time at choice .
we &apos;ve managed to get around a hundred genes from the 500 , or something like this .
so we had to develop a new method with which we put these little bits together and correct the mistakes .
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
we have problems with food , with fresh and safe water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
and even the ones who don &apos;t actually set up to be a lot of their talents seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how they get taken in the next century .
but in the old greece and rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
but then i remembered how tom talked to the free sky , and i tried it .
and i want to give you to a report that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
when something happened then , people knew what this was . they called it his name .
what i have to say to myself is when i &apos;m crazy about this , i &apos;m not afraid .
an interesting fact with this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
i just have to step back a little bit , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m concerned about with modern molecular biology .
extremely important , now is very important , and much more importantly , much more important in the future .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
you need biological materials , of course , and you need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
and with that , you can accelerate the particles very hard , and then you go into the onion .
so , you know , that you just get to be able to connect with these technologies , with the scientific technologies .
you may even know , if you &apos;re interested in this , the australian league of the australian world .
and we have the linearity as a law , and there are only exceptions , like , for example , for example .
and we had the most violent , we had the age of man , and we &apos;re going to go back to the so-called .
but these concepts of the product that allow us to discover these opportunities back back to our capabilities .
and i brought this project , as an example , as an example , again , , again , which is cognitive models .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re looking at next to the real existence as a creator .
because often people are coming , they can &apos;t do it , so that everybody can deal with it .
and then you go , you know , in the middle class , as well as the subject of perception and the human race .
namely , she &apos;s an assumption in front of the beginning that you see something you see , what you recognize .
back to my actual topic of natural users , and the subject of natural users , the subject of course , is the same .
and i can use it right now , or i need &quot; n &quot; and i need it to be kind of an engineer .
so , once again , that &apos;s what happens to be the success of success , it &apos;s just a target app .
and that &apos;s not exactly the same thing , because because we don &apos;t know how much of it is going on .
you think of it in this time by looking at contemporary images , and reading literature .
our organism has invented a great way of making such unpleasant emotions like envy just to get rid of it .
i want to explain to you about this mechanism today , or something , which is what you might be familiar with .
yeah , you feel it if you &apos;re whistling at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
and what we can now read almost every day in the daily newspaper , find them in this third sentence .
the world &apos;s chief of the world , which is going to be deleted , because you don &apos;t need permission .
here we see that again , again , again , again , the egyptian , again , again , all the individuals .
and then they only use what is there on the sun and the wind there , where they live .
and while i was playing , it occurred to me that in northern afghanistan , it was a complete change .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts , charles darwin , and part of a crocodile to kiss .
it turns out that miguel has spent the biggest part of his career in the national park in africa .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than only feeding the world .
and that &apos;s because the people at the north here are the most active , and they &apos;re over here on the morning .
now , what we have here is the most single &quot; goodbye &quot; goodbye , which has ever been printed .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the sports .
our intention was to look at , and look at the inner ship , which has never been done before .
and so you see animals that are right next to 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive .
and at the same time , i was also very interested in the same time , which was back back to my childhood .
but in the art and at studying , failure has to be an alternative , because there &apos;s no doubt there .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
these are very good things , and it &apos;s a very good thing to do , to make these services available almost every one on the planet .
you told me they don &apos;t bite . in fact , they probably won &apos;t leave the glass .
and when you get inexpensive and simple , you get enough fuel , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
well , let &apos;s go to the destination that we have to do , and then we talk about this .
a few years ago at ted , here at ted , peter krishnan asked a newspaper called &quot; the mother . &quot;
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a hot field .
as peter said , they didn &apos;t only use the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
and why ? because they are triangles and the geometric geometric geometric patterns to build the key structures .
if you have 10 teams who are unique , you get about six , the robust structures .
they have shaped the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever made .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of scientific method .
people are sitting in their faith , and that &apos;s how close you can &apos;t free them .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship for progress as we used to .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a projector .
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
our memory tells us stories that means what we need to keep from our experience is a story .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought these patients were they suffered ? &quot;
that &apos;s going to lead to the patient , but only a little bit less than that .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted is , when this person thinks about their life .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two species .
is this something you can tell us about , because now you have a few minutes left ?
60,000 dollars a year are people unhappy , and they &apos;re becoming less miserable , the poorer they will .
people are , you know , they &apos;re supposed to be aware of happiness , if you think about politics .
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which provides the ideal environment to the communal problem .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to finish their epic mission .
so many people are currently in the world who spend at least one hour per day .
and over the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good in whatever .
so i started thinking about what it &apos;s like to be able to master these games .
there was one such great famine , that the king of the king of the king was decided to be a crazy idea .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling that lasted almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re all the oil . &quot;
the calculation is that the calculation of a network that people have only left 23 years on the planet .
in particular , the last two words , the last two words , &quot; near &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
just to say a human being as a child to call it a child , it might take it off and give you ideas .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
he understood that medical diagnosis , and how someone involved with it , are two different things .
so this is also what &apos;s going on in the speech of this talk , so i hope , d ate it .
evolution is all about preparing the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation generation .
in the good way , in the evil , and earlier , as you might think , these decisions are going to be on us .
but not only that -- to merge them with the universe and other gadgets out there .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increase my strength and persistence .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chapter in mobility .
if i don &apos;t belong to poverty , i &apos;m going to get the fire in a volunteer room at a volunteer meeting .
this is just a little taste on the insights that bonobos give us in our past and present .
in this case , i worked with people who have the social norms , the social norms .
so , for example , i worked with people who are the most ugly twins , two people in a body .
and as a consequence , his encrypted male has been tied up , his brain was exposed to the male male .
some people with the chromosomes are going to develop something called the weather system , which is what &apos;s going to mean , in fact , of the walls .
for example , we move to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
and we find men in the front lines of the chain , which say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people in different forms of color , which are based on terms of differences in terms of shifting differences , again , successful , successful .
well , just to conclude , i want to see that i talked a lot about the fathers .
i &apos;m allowed to reduce the impact of my childhood to the environment , and also the ones on my wallet .
the next day , all of the time went to the center and the prime minister and the prime minister at the same time .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in spain , spain .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just that architecture disappears almost .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
you can have some kind of constructive screen or an ad , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first ventricles .
then one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; dad , my legs . &quot;
i met with his father and his brother , and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal to be in life , a good father .
i received another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live differently .
it could be , say , for example , an american power station , or it could be in germany .
so , after what we were looking for as first , the first thing we were looking for , was because we know what to do .
and the great digital revolution -- we got a glimpse of what we were looking at , and we looked very closely at all the time .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- i &apos;ve made it really out of socks .
and so the film is going to look at this whole idea -- this is what ? in eternity , forever ?
and i thought , &quot; well , think of the camera , &quot; that we wanted to make a difference .
technology is not the way you want to describe something that someone is doing under the front lines .
and i think the pattern , the style that i think is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
let me just tell you a little bit of a little bit like this with your thoughts and feelings about yourself .
in the entire city , for five years , it &apos;s been for five years , no poster , no two-year-olds , nothing .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency this : what &apos;s going on right now with the $ $ unclear &#93; ?
and so i started playing around , and i realized there was something going on there .
just to give you a little bit of reference , i figure out , you see what you get .
and i was asked to get asked to come up and give a talk about the fourth and five january of january .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes in the nine minutes ?
and he pointed out to the most popular of tourists that came every day , and they usually had their cameras .
from the people who were there when they were 24 percent , only three percent actually bought a glass .
in the plans that were almost offered 60 fund , they dropped down to about the most prolific percent .
they push the decision -- push it , even if it &apos;s against their own interests .
those who really want to make a selection will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
the one on the left is jazz and the on the right , but you know what ?
the only thing i did is to change the sequence of this information .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re choosing choice .
today we want to talk about how videos are going , and then why it &apos;s important at all .
again , it &apos;s only a tiny percentage of times , and it &apos;s going to be seen thousands and thousands of times and so on .
and the next thing is about four women in three generations who are building a new life together .
we let ourselves go down , and we had this one of the most populated megawatts , which is the population of orangutans .
my mother worked on farms , then on a assembly line in a nanotube , six days , six days , double layers .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
nevertheless , my interest in photography , when i got my first digital camera , was at age 15 .
and if you make good pictures , the result is pretty beautiful , and also pretty realistic .
so it &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that is limited to us is our imagination .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you through a short video .
we had a team last year from teenage fellows in boston , which is the code for america .
and sure , we would have this fire hydrant all over the time , and many people do .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is what &apos;s going to happen in the way here .
in other words , the future has declined every year for me in this world .
and every time it divided up , they have evolved to more chemicals in these chemicals .
so the nervous system has the system of using this particular kind of light , because evolution could now happen within a individual .
and what we &apos;ve actually done , in fact , we &apos;ve started to abstract humanity .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow us to produce .
we talked about that that nothing has changed since the age of ancient india &apos;s &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
it became an investigative access to a world full of pirates and plastic ships and images in my imagination .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into natural world with their technology .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
i put my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the end of the census , until the beginning of the second world war .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and make this crazy case .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
and then , according to charles leadbeater , it &apos;s the last 130 year of 25 percent in the last 130 years .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the most violent of the earth , could have never been taught for such luxury procedures .
think about that a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
three billion new minds , which we &apos;ve never heard before , will become the global communication .
never make a mistake , no one does the details of how to do this .
and i learned in my little office in the sisters in the sisters of toronto at the toronto , general hospital of this .
and i gave her medicine , which we call the water we call water , and we put water on the liquid .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was probably no instruction in their treatment .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he was discovering a while in the right sector , he called the surgeons .
we have a cognitive error , so we can take a perfect design for a patient with a patient .
the transit of these transfers were very productive and the fishermen were good of it , and they were doing a lot of it in ghana .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the southern lobe .
because obviously an animal that there was very often , first of all times , before it was .
how about the arab spring and the things that happened for example in egypt ?
in the same year , in the same year , the bell labs was the next revolution , the next building block .
and just like that biosphere biosphere , it happened , it happened to be a lot of the speed -- only greater speed .
each language is like a solar forest of mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
they &apos;re not taught anymore . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
their hunters were able to smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away , and determine what animal species was .
he &apos;s on the side of the fence , and when it was frozen , it was completely frozen , and it was frozen .
an amazing example , such as a nation , a state of state , a state , can look for its people and achieve .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could do a , or we could make b .
and what she found was a 10 year-old license that was offered the employers , took the participation in two percent .
and the more ways to get there to selection , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to take into account .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have a concrete expectations when it was in a way .
so the secret to the secret -- that &apos;s what they all came for -- the secret to the secret , are low expectations .
and that &apos;s the most important thing that we &apos;re going to do generally better , objective , and we feel bad .
pygmies , a sense of view of the world -- and that it &apos;s the way i read it first .
and the more i thought about it , the more i thought i knew the fish .
but this is a recipe of a whirlwind cultural argument , and it &apos;s a recipe for misery , and i suspect disaster .
we found 30 mistakes in the field of 30 , and if we were using the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism named the three million rads of radiation to radiation .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and can move around , looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get the process to the process .
we need about five billion tons of coal , and this is a hundred million barrels of oil . this is a hundred million barrels per day .
so in minus parking degrees , when the space between the stars , these wires can be the tension of tension .
the result is , i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i was going to be the fall .
the question i want to ask everybody here is : is this idea for you all right ?
the artist &apos;s artist was protected in front of certain things , like , for example , too much effort , right ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a second moment when i can take care of you .
he &apos;s only a training solo with golf bags , and maybe he &apos;s never going to go back to that altitude .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a more powerful thing in the last 25 years .
professor trained walter &apos;s university in alaska with another set of fish , traveled to another flat lake last winter .
in the himalayas , the most cosmopolitan , you see , new lakes , you see , there are some glaciers that were going on .
here are the ones that were shot in the last few years with some green alternatives that were proposed .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , dirty fuels , which cleans our world .
i want to start by asking you for the time of your childhood , when you were playing with the sex .
and then , after about 30 seconds , after about 30 seconds , then you get mixed up and you &apos;ve got a new new opportunity and new opportunities to try .
and so out of interest in this technology , i &apos;m just going on on this technology .
there &apos;s a group on the lower left , which is a group of indonesia called , but it &apos;s pretty long .
and then the visitors could go into the room in the room , sit on this chair , sit on this helmet .
so , to speak of cognitive models , these are the models that we have in the pre-industrial times .
and so it &apos;s so heavily rooted in us that we can deal with virtuality .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions were taken over songs .
i &apos;ve been asked to see if this bag is there a bag , and i &apos;m going to talk .
so , a very , very energetic process , like certain things do happen , and what &apos;s going to happen to be happening .
once i saw that , that &apos;s because there &apos;s a spike in there , you know .
but i want to say that , of course , for us , it &apos;s an equal increase for us , also , to make things happen .
that &apos;s an acronym , you know , and it &apos;s an acronym , and it says , you know , it &apos;s an acronym , it &apos;s an acronym .
i &apos;m about to do this , practically all this whole , very large , major , 40 years , in quality .
this is like i would say , &quot; your child , &quot; just three times , just three times .
you &apos;ve been able to have a hundred thousand billion years old , because you &apos;ve always been able to balance the nutrients .
because the ground is going to die the mosses and the wind and the water is washing away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , everyone means the footprint that the water is staying in the meadow .
you read in the letters , you read , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts from composers themselves .
it &apos;s also wonderful when i &apos;m standing on a stage on stage , and we have the same wavelength .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so that he was already starting to study when i started studying .
i mean , you can &apos;t sing , a , because you believe they cannot sing ?
with time , you can also get some references and you want to make some more spices there , or taste even fine differences .
and when i come up with my little v , and i &apos;m going to tell you about it , this feeling comes up .
and then that awkward feeling that it may not look like you , and it &apos;s always going to give you more and more and more .
we don &apos;t just have the art in the art room , but in the science of science , it &apos;s such great lies .
we need to prevent the people who have knowledge , especially when they &apos;re true .
and so just like that , just like these words that we &apos;re using in the language of the political language , it &apos;s always used again .
and if we &apos;re here in southern siberia , i remember , i remember the brain level of brain science .
immediately , you &apos;ll be able to find one of those things that you have , of course , that you can &apos;t prove .
and the most amazing ones that the most successful thing that did on the island is , we find that great .
so over here , we &apos;re going to simulate the whole thing called the whole area , the wires of the cable , to sort of map the web in the net .
that is , if you &apos;re at 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without any storage .
if you don &apos;t have that , this rotating mass , then you have to replace it and replace it .
we have now got over 10 million million years old , and we &apos;re now going to get to the german net .
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , water , corn , dry , dry and food . &quot;
and yet , when i tried to do it in this restaurant restaurant , she didn &apos;t tasted it at all .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of inequalities in the distribution , not the greenhouse .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single one of these pieces and reduced them to a little summary .
here we see a very basic service . there are light at home so you can read the homework ?
the idea was really tangible for them , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
in fact , we &apos;re investing in dozens of thousands of companies doing great things and have interesting opportunities and i try to support this .
we have to pursue these breakthroughs , and we can measure this , and we can measure this : in southern siberia , in the blink , in southern afghanistan .
tell them that there &apos;s negative effects to do that with the clouds of clouds that are moving ?
if you get a lot of the time you can get a very high , very high school , you can only get the rich .
and we &apos;ve never been able to be able to fix him , like we can today .
and listen , everybody has a right on their opinion , even a right on their opinion .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our not worthy , and we have to stop it .
in fact , it &apos;s so determined in his place that i can shake it , without the knife .
the reason i put my wrist wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
right ? a syringe with a wooden -- a pair of noise &apos;s substance , which you can sew with a patient .
we know from this study that you have to reach the needle if it &apos;s supposed to go .
so the stories of the world were different , and because a very important part of the story is how they end .
now , if i ever opened the folder with 600 pictures of it , i spent another hour .
and the main lesson that we think i &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the self , you will be doing very different things at the end .
rs : you know , i think there are recognition for the role of the world trade in politics .
and in reality , if we fail , if we &apos;re on obstacles , we often feel differently .
but to see it in context , in front of millions of years ago , our first ever started to go upright .
his work is a great thing . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money money .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be the witness of less than a handout in virtual worlds , and we &apos;re talking . &quot;
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more than in the real life .
according to 18 years old , the famine didn &apos;t work better . so the king decided , a last day .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , which is how we understand the future .
we want to think about the best possible results , and then help people to make this idea into reality .
find out how they would survive . most of our players are going to keep out in the game .
and the last game we get out on march three . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
when you finish the game , you get from the world bank , &quot; social media , &quot; in 2010 .
i &apos;m really hoping that we &apos;re playing great games together to survive on this planet .
so i immediately returned to the art of 2009 , and i expected to find that i &apos;m here .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- except my favorite .
but most importantly , it is between the perception of our flaws and our great capacity , there is a connection .
perhaps that &apos;s the sense of disagreement , a sense of the success of the world , a sense of our own power .
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
the human part of this network , far at the end , is , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
i mean , do you think , if antonio damasio asks for her sense of the bacteria ?
it &apos;s a really easier way for germs to bacteria , with occasional interruptions of estrogen , forced to move .
but else , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just like they &apos;re important for their lives .
or are we a little bit different -- something that might even be better to the environment ?
do we use those decisions to form society that is better , which is more successful ?
now let &apos;s take our look at the wheelchair , something that i &apos;m passionate about .
and so , by the way , it has been 500 years since that , as i have to say , very successful .
they have to go up to the top of the fire , and you have to get this woman a few shoes . &quot;
i was wearing my pills down , where i met my nemesis and the beloved dog .
that means we have a shared ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
and if you look at bonobos at stake , you see the evolutionary origins of human populations , dance and rituals .
and i want to show you that , that &apos;s a young female , a young female , and it plays peaceful with water .
i know they were out there , i know that they were running , but they were great .
the usda of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the fittest .
evelyn , on the other hand , is born to the actual world , so he was born at a march in 1980 .
heinrich can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you about about the beginning .
this is from an exhibition , the paola antonelli for moma later in the year , in the summer .
then we have the little potato chips that put little brands on the garbage , and they started tracking it .
and if it &apos;s a windy , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even let the roof down .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical power of water , and the projection of water and the projection .
and this is what led us to think about this project that i &apos;m showing you now .
if you turn the lights out , it looks like that , so just like we saw before .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we also had to break in the parking parking lot , so we felt kind of a part of the brain .
so basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it can do it possible .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find because you drop it somewhere .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned today .
and i was exhausted the time that i was going to clean things that i &apos;ve been wasting with people who mean something .
ralph , it was reported a lot of it that people assume that this is the most important thing behind it is .
some of you may have heard that i took a drawing on ebay a couple of weeks ago .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a mistake , and that was what it was done .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
and we went into school school where companies are going to bend their way , in all the americas .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
you can go ahead and create your own museum online -- from all these images you can build your own collection .
i went to a clean space with new computer projects , and i had a hundred hours on all the major stuff .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today that there &apos;s less .
half of the customers are going to go from the many possibilities , 56 pounds to the low opportunities , four gears .
and that &apos;s what was very surprising and humorous , was casey &apos;s funny idea , and his argument five million times .
for them , life had asked her a task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
in other words , unlike the most successful , their existence was completely unknown to me , they didn &apos;t have to have a plastic accident .
and the most pessimistic broken system was killed between people who had one thing in common : they started new .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant things , and we made the breakthrough .
and if you take a picture of a camera , the process ends with the process , when you squeeze on the trigger .
so , i wanted to create something else , something that the process begins when the trigger is pushed .
we &apos;ve got three perfect reactors here that we can identify with all of us in a three-dimensional world .
so we cheat our brains , because our brain is very simply not convinced that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
so i would say that there &apos;s three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
one of the most important things is that we have to think that government is not the same as politics .
and that &apos;s a novelty that we have to use this type of scale of curves in the technology of technology .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the developing world , a new kind of world .
in fact , the recipe is for us , which is our genes , from the exact same code and the same notation .
and i &apos;ve got 100 hours of a white fortune , which i &apos;m trying to keep in airports , trying to keep in airports .
at that point , we have multicellular communities , communities of many of the agricultural communities that are operating together as individual organism .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , for a process which is different from the classic engineering technology .
we &apos;re at a point where the analog is the analog to the back of the day .
well , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m listening to you now before i &apos;m going to go even further .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane if for nine planes , the hidden one .
this mental orientation is the core of what i think is also the most powerful thing to do .
you mean , god , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
and only by the way , the largest oil industry against a population explosion is a better education and nutrition throughout the world .
&quot; aw &quot; seems to appear soon and turns on statistics and to use this great baseball team .
i went to a train attack here in toronto as a woman , and i had a medical printer in the hospital of the hospital .
two days later , i came up to my next day , and i asked my birth to a conversation in her office .
in a field of care , the medical wisdom is doubling every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
this is a story that we &apos;ve heard a lot of times from the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
in fact , countries that started 100 fish , the industrial fishing of this quite ugly ship called the fourth 4 .
the reason it &apos;s changed is -- in this case -- in this case , a hard reason or soft corals is going to be viable .
at the time , it changes . it changes , because for people , their actions are very natural .
we want to get things that disappeared , or things that are not more like they were .
let &apos;s look at what really happened in the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
until the day , they &apos;re governed by a ritual priesthood , and the education is very extraordinary .
so this is a lot of thousands of you &apos;ve heard of , the most powerful thing that you &apos;ve heard about , the most powerful thing that you &apos;ve heard about .
now you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have a fear of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think of the shredder information that many of these images have .
they &apos;re offering 50 percent reduction -- 10 percent less employees are taking part as if they were only offering five . why ?
and these other things may have related properties , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
it may sound like genomic color , but we can , by changing the way , change things quite dramatically .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it will look . we know exactly how their genetic code is going to look .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first one of the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
this is where i work . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 meters in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism and people started to believe that creativity completely came from their own individual .
they got the poem on his tail , and he pulled it back into their body and took it on the sheet of paper .
when i heard this , i thought i was really curious -- that &apos;s just like my creative process .
even i had work or ideas that i can &apos;t relate to me , which i can &apos;t identify .
because you see , i &apos;m doing everything i have , investing . i don &apos;t have more than that .
but this doesn &apos;t push strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
this is called the amur , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
the red thread , which connects all these together , is our dependence on the fossil fuels like dirty coal and coal oil .
he can bring new characters to the scene by putting the flow of the table that shows this character .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s happened in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , and that &apos;s where the internet came from .
and that &apos;s not in the classroom , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
it &apos;s like , yes , how a kind of aircraft , you know , that &apos;s like , you know , two inches or something like that .
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen right now in the moment .
and in this head , knowledge and using this virtual imagery , the imagination , was also knowing the knowledge .
maybe you can get up to a second , so you can get up in the pause with the two of them .
and that &apos;s sort of thinking that i think of the outside world , so i explore the real world .
not if i think locally , and the neighbor thinks less organic , it doesn &apos;t work all the time .
and what does it mean , of course , intuitively and how does our channels work of perception and how does cognitive processing work ?
we are more likely to be on symbolic , on the surface , which we also consider as a creator of course .
and this is on a higher grail of the fittest than the transmission of a classical metaphor , which is the most part of the world .
so all the western sizes are always expanding , until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re 13.7 .
you think that the choir is in the notes exactly everything he imagined , which he imagined .
his cause to write the piece is always becoming more and more and more to my personal concerns .
i think that the stream would have been excited if he had had the perpetual possible possibilities of modern design today .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , that you have to do with it .
here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention of our primary invention .
we need this lie to this lie , which is the deception that we can &apos;t have yet .
that the person from the monkey developed and , yes , there was a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
but there are no professors where we can tell ourselves where you can learn how to make fire .
it &apos;s just interested in having to change yourself in front of the need to prove that there &apos;s no evidence .
i have to say , you know , you &apos;ve got it very hard to talk to me about my idea .
the imf is going to be able to control , and the wind , the sun , the sun is going to be able to create the burden of the map .
that means that at the moment , you have to worry that renewables can take the whole network .
that &apos;s in the little style , so you can also use your car pressure in your car , you know .
but if you want to get multiple of these pieces of data and you want to build a net , that &apos;s extremely complicated .
and to that purpose , people always come and look at our flu , sort of our favorite team .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can put a piece of future out there .
because the music allows him to help his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
they built this complicated set of channels , and they pulled water out of the country and out into the river .
well , i don &apos;t like that question , because it &apos;s been the logic of our life for the last 50 years .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it will be delicious .
my response to that was drawing and painting from aliens , aliens , alien worlds , robots and all this stuff .
from those two experiences , a whole new world was reached , a whole new world of creativity of creativity .
that &apos;s how the circle of the circle between my existence , as a child , , as a child , as a child .
there were people who thought we were really good at this , and they were transported to the planet .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david &apos;am , &quot; which is the hot air . &quot;
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times the amount of energy without changing its lifestyle .
and , although it really seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard to get people to work very quickly .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on top of the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
so the performance is to work with prototypes , but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
in the rich world , diseases that have millions of us are still threatened by one generation , hardly yet .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccination for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
but i was worried about this article , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it .
a few weeks ago , i wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i thought , i &apos;m a little too sharp .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
everything we eat , every single branch of parsley , every branch of parsley , each bradley , has changed by the people .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our external food , a better food , unique food food .
we can move them to where we want to move them , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
a colored capsule , which is at an end yellow and on the other red , is better than a white capsule .
maybe too much time , if you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we &apos;re feeling threatened , perhaps , maybe depressed , frustrated , frustrated or ephemeral .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
we don &apos;t have that in real life , that feeling that a lot of employees are ready to stand .
also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspirational story , why we &apos;re there and what we have to do .
you &apos;ve heard of &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + a strength &quot; or &quot; + &quot; powers 1 intelligence . &quot;
until today , all the world &apos;s world graduates have been spending millions of years to solve the virtual problems of data .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome : players are more appreciative , hopeful individuals .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
a person who opened the doors for me was my pediatrician at the dismay of kenyan institute in 2001 .
and we don &apos;t like our kids if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
and of course , to hear the heart that vice versa was told , they &apos;re just enough .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family will decide .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
we put our assumptions out of the outside of the tree , where , not surprisingly , he got a lot more attention than i was .
don &apos;t wait for making a difference in a different life , until you reached your first million .
and yet , in this country , of violence and chaos , you can hear a sense that the trees are shattered .
i think , just like you &apos;re playing , sometimes you &apos;re alone , and we &apos;re shrinking boundaries of our inner and outer worlds .
and in the other case , the sperm carries a x chromosome that hits x chromosome to the higgs chromosome .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to see testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
but today we are in a situation where we want to take vital organs to people and want to put them in other people .
i &apos;m a politically believer people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
so they did this part because they were part of a system of a system where two things in common .
i don &apos;t want to say that there &apos;s supposed to be the right to give you your informed consent to sex or to marry .
i answered him , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got a lot of anguish , rather than a surgery to separate it ? &quot;
if you surround yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;ll notice it .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a piece of life , and a piece of time .
now , look at what happened this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
all of the kids who came out of the house came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
it could have a momentum of a impulse that is going to have a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or whatever .
so the idea is that we actually put people together , and they &apos;re doing things together .
so both the physical cloud in the sky , and something on the top of the top you can go like in london .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separate from nature and that everything is connected .
and it starts with the hypothermia , then the bands , after all , then they &apos;re going to do the design , and the people actually do art .
my circle started at the high school in the &apos; 60s at high school in ohio , ohio , where i was going on .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve got to go , and that i want you to go up . &quot;
while i was thinking about it later , a saying that , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad wines . &quot;
they &apos;re going to go through the gray box , and then the centrifuge , and the palestinian reed , and the iranian and the iranian winter .
notre seals looked like a computer that didn &apos;t like our cheese , but they didn &apos;t want to eat it .
and after we were experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to see that this is a relative attack .
so , in the large and all of us , we &apos;re very hopeful that we actually determines what the goal is .
so it &apos;s just like being fed in , where the car drivers have been fed off with previously before .
and every time i get somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
a lot of health negotiations , and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
those of you who are really interested in art can click down here -- but i click it away now .
i think finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from google .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be with this digital medium of art , and they &apos;re going to represent it online .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
so , imagine if you were at the same time at the same time , how would that feel ?
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than it costs to build .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
this is a picture of a big , new city city built in south korea , which is built in south korea .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
so in these plans , we had about the plans of plans that allowed people to publish something between two to 59 different fund .
and what brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with is the problem of the problem , it &apos;s the key .
the other half of customers go from the low possibilities , four gears , four gears , a lot of opportunities .
there was a meeting to the reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
she reminded me that i was so old now as she had , when we climbed the boat .
and even though i had graduated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t stand with a career in law .
they grew up at a time when the social norm and the local was the most important person .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of it is so cold ? &quot;
so for me , photography seemed to be more about to be the right place at the right time .
and yes , i even got the house up on the island of red , to make wal-mart look .
and i think the most important point is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
make ways to use that are easily and start to hug patients in the team .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean up these bionicles .
it was about a method that parents can find out what the right public schools are for their children .
and as many people , i thought it was mainly about choosing people in office .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we all fight , which is , who can talk ; they all have to talk .
either of it &apos;s going to be a classic classic like this , and it &apos;s something that is completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen .
in any way that we don &apos;t even understand that , this droplet is the ability to learn information about information .
if i was in reality , i would have written it on a virus , and it was released in the room .
now these communications allowed for the reasons of communities that were in a sense in the same boat ; they were very poor .
let &apos;s say , i want numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been using for this .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written from hand .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single marble .
we &apos;ve heard all of the people , and how many people outside of india , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues ?
and sometimes when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and strength that otherwise otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise . &quot;
the united states of america is the only country in the world , the most violent children in prison .
in south africa , people understood that the seismic is not over to overcome the willingness and reconciliation .
if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i was here at ted a new university called singularity university university .
but then the technology &apos;s technology was developed , and made it so cheap that we used to use it with our transportation system .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet with more energy than we consume every year .
they live in a world that has information and communication in abundance , as nobody could have ever predicted .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistic that i hope most of you &apos;ve heard about before .
suppose you &apos;ve got an online , and you &apos;re going to bring them into a more aggressive , which is a little bit of 400 times in terms of color .
other doctors fear that same as well , but the basic reason is very special because we &apos;re just seeing the patients .
if i was in a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about me .
and that was an example of what our own governments are doing , the technology against us , the citizens .
the first set of smallpox was produced , and the very simple idea of a simple idea : built out of cement with a full metric of cement that fit .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
lego basically has the most basic , the building block of the world , and it made a building block for our imagination .
the transistor allows us to build a lot more complex , more complex , more complex , more complex , to the other .
rather than that you have to program , you have to program , or you have to program , you have to allow them to program simple intuitive gestures .
i grew up in the woods of british columbia , and i believed that these forests were going to be there .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re also going to achieve this area .
the answer is , you &apos;re looking at the next morning , and asking for a change of the prescription .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things , and lifestyle , life is a choice of choice .
the happiness is lower the happiness that we get through our selection , even if what we chose is fantastic .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that &apos;s actually able to build its own hardware in a biological system .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , the digital information is really accurate .
this letter of letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose of any of these amino acids .
so people who think about evolution as a gene has changed a lot from biology .
and it &apos;s just a selection of selection , and we can be able to go out of the production of chemicals , production of chemicals , and so on .
but to be fair -- the group of chemists are not given the names of the people who don &apos;t get rid of their name .
by socrates , he believed that he believed that he had to have an argument who knows he &apos;s going to come up to him .
in these opportunities , the poem came out and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
and he just looked in the sky and said , &quot; excuse me , can &apos;t you see that i &apos;m driving car ? &quot;
a lot more importantly , though , are physically , why you can only get them out of your hands and access to your hands .
so , i think we &apos;re in the process of view , even a step beyond the academic world .
he then made this helmet up there , and in cooperation with the museum , it went to the museum .
now we think our love to stories depends on us as a child on the lap of our parents .
and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce , which is the real world .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you see right now .
so a lot of natural , more natural , but i look exactly exactly where is salt and pepper in it .
and in the left just intuitive , and hopefully i hope that there is no sugar in it , you know , there &apos;s no sugar .
i &apos;ll get the whole picture , now , and can filter it , and can say , just show me all the things with chocolate .
every day , they give you an order of magnitude about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus .
if i go to dinner and say yes , yes , there &apos;s a pill with a pill and a glass of water .
just if you take these lava-tube patterns , you squirt them , rusty and the powder to plant trees .
today , i want to give you what i read differently , which is , again , in a verbal language .
today , a modern orchestra in the situation is able to play everything that has suffered a orchestra from then .
but it &apos;s kind of like this kind of thing that comes out of a hundred watts out of the square ridge , which was a toy .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you have to communicate in the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
we can start to integrate on the island that we can do , to integrate drugs , and we can start to manage the burden .
so a lot of people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first symphony and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine .
i said , &quot; miguel , fly down to the farm , and then fly 240 miles down the door , and then fly down the night ?
okay . a farm that &apos;s not feeding their fish , a farm that measures their success at the success of their predators .
and when it was fought through the system , and this leaves his leaves , the water is clean than it is .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about it or not .
so what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in fact , where food is really good .
so you see that this is a very important view of information and data in this way , in a living environment .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got two years later to face two years later when we moved to california .
i &apos;ve convinced you , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the train . we &apos;re talking the real train .
no one had ever explored the inside of the internet , and you didn &apos;t have any means for it , so we developed the technology .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
all right , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction to a factor three or maybe even a factor of six .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to shine all day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be all the same day , and the wind doesn &apos;t always move .
this is what happens when you try to say these vents , and we &apos;re going to get 20 percent of the rest of the rest .
so to reach this 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , are completely changing .
you should talk about this kind of thing , and you &apos;d be shocked by the silly few funds that are spent for these innovative approaches .
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;re often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world are hungry every day .
but now , when you get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and you &apos;re not good at that .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him where his kids go to school .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon children will die , because that &apos;s only one question of numbers .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
i know that we can , and as far as it is , that &apos;s what the world needs now .
for the sake of self , not better than a holiday holiday , because there &apos;s no new memories , because there &apos;s no new memories .
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the self itself over time .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they won &apos;t get the proper answer .
but always on the edge of their skills , so they have to get hard . but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the most violent of the oil is 22 hours a week , so you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
they have collected more information about world of warcraft in the internet than any other other kind of topic in any other wiki world .

today , three people on this planet are born for every one of the year , and within 40 years , it will be four .
this is actually a shot of the fact that we &apos;re working with , where you &apos;re actually designing and designing new species on the computer .
now , the engineers under you will look at them and say , &quot; no that doesn &apos;t . that &apos;s little wires . &quot;
for example , you get all concerned to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to have this success ?

this is a 18 inches long , and it &apos;s very , very pointed . and i &apos;ll first get you a little bit sterile .
what &apos;s really telling us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
and yet , you get kind of the impression that you should count , that what happens during these moments of view , is our lives .
and as we would use it , it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that holds the growth of itself for us .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who are moving to california in hope , happier .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to dramatically increase this time .
and if you get it , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually able to do something like this . that &apos;s a fucking victory .

whenever i go on the road , and always , if i open up the door , you &apos;ll see that they &apos;ll be transported to see .
well , we can &apos;t all be the most sophisticated , but i often see myself at the intersection of the dark glamour , and i can see it .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
and i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people get to think about , that our world is designing .

and i met people in all the projects , so many of them were doing what they loved in the limits of possible .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we &apos;re going to interpret the world , and how it can be made in a two-dimensional surface .
but in a certain way , you can combine something , you can create something that still looks three-dimensional , if it could exist .

if we wouldn &apos;t print it with a 10 and a half of 10 and distances , it would contain the pages of pages , just to put this genetic code together .
i don &apos;t know if this was created the biggest thing , or this is when someone came to the google side and they found the front page .

and this is an aerial thing , which is the one that &apos;s just mentioned , this one , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of like molecular biology , for molecular biology .
and that was pretty intuitive , so everyone has just his desires , and that &apos;s what he &apos;s doing , and what he said is , then .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , reproduce , fragments , fragments of fragments , so you can make them visible .
and if i tell someone , i &apos;ll give you salt or pepper , and then he &apos;s going to be thinking about where it is .

i &apos;m saying that i &apos;m going to throw my wrist , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve or away , and that &apos;s a lie .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the precise statistic . i &apos;m sorry .
so , it &apos;s so , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little duplicate .
why we chose to pick up the food that we &apos;re choosing is a problem that is a choice of the two species of self .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how hard it is .
players always believe that a complete victory victory is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying to try and do it .
so i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i designed to try and allow people to allow people to try to get people into their own future .
and found out that we have found people from the members of our society , one of the things that we have to do is to be useful , to be useful and to contribute .
what if you could make the genetic change , to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or reducing the risk of death or stroke ?
so we thought we were going to take this challenge , and we think we were going to be able to do a design that would help with this problem .
the technologies have been told me since , to learn to go back , to climb , to climb , to climb and drive the hands .
a couple of weeks later , the most popular one had a letter that they had to do for the brave use of their house .
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because life of the bonobos are more than the cama of the bonobos .
and if we faced with a body that is actually something that is very different to us , it &apos;s confused us in terms of these issues .
we have hard conversations about what a body becomes for people , so that he has a right right now than the fetal life .
the founding fathers ruins this idea , and they traded through a new computer concept , and that concept said that all humans were created in the same way .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , was born three months , and she was born at the one june in 1980 .
maria , however , can &apos;t be in all states in all states the same right , the heinrich in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
in our quest for democracy , we did our thing really well , and i think we would do our thing in the future .
i forgot that i was going to bet everything i might have wanted to wear , if i first got to palm springs .
and you can see him , and he &apos;s going to open up to make it open , like you can see in this picture .
if you look at a iceberg , you think that they &apos;re isolated , separate and alone , as we often see humans .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and this hacker and programmers and programmers have taken our house and adopted our house .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks of time , i went back and forth , tony &apos;s nights , tony drew the first time for seven years .
the third thing i learned -- and that &apos;s when the internal clock rose , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 ... &quot;
so what we did , and we found the code of the code , and we found that it &apos;s in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger one .
i believe that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;ve prepared all the company to get a profit .
and the biggest question that i asked you recently is , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a child &apos;s experience ? &quot;
so i would better feel better with the whole thing , if we could sort of show that everyday threats also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal , that piece of metal , we had to go out all the way out .
when we put the lights out , the light lights , and the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes did this ; the other half but not yet .
but you know what they were about to be in these apartments and their environment in the environment , to avoid cheating , and by cutting away from it .
in improvement , and by studying consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city .
in a country that has just a tremendous crisis behind it , congress has been elected for this kind of tube to a voice .
if you think that the guy on the left is jazz , and the one on the right side side is going to clap , please clap .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the simple hope of oneness and freedom of his home was together .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the theme of the last 10 years , a big problem for the last 10 years , is that children in their rooms are sitting on their own computers , without go out .
we all move to a world where the forces of the technology are getting closer and closer to the magic and technology .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher meaning meaning , but the words of a dedicated teacher are specifically meaningful .
she sat me down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to see that i watched you . &quot;
for me , it means time for me to think and talk about the poor , the disadvantaged , which never will be at ted .
and then , you know , a woman named , and i said , &quot; aw , ms. parks comes to the town . we want to talk to us .
i &apos;m going to visit a client , and i go to a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and that &apos;s as an adult as an adult .
it touched something very deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribute every single one to a community , to a perspective of hope .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , coca-cola will apply this technology globally into the entire planet .
so if this device sequenced a piece or a catcher that &apos;s not known , it &apos;s called the health companies and prevents a pandemic in front of their bank .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give , is about cameron , so it &apos;s called &quot; avatar ii . &quot;
and while we &apos;re today , in 2011 , our governments like trust , our governments are right , and they &apos;re always being stated .
they put us in the position of building things that were bigger than us , building buildings , a stone after another .
so if you &apos;ve seen once you &apos;ve seen this stuff , like this stuff , this substance , this substance that you produce from various species as well .
so that the powder to be specific is about the equivalent of a bottom-up shot of the cotton paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
he was smuggled in the prison of two years in the prison , to hide under her hometown , because she couldn &apos;t live .
you can see that if we can create this kind of view of what we can do with images and make the experience of the fittest .
as if you do a design sample for images , where you &apos;re making sentences , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about that , which is the picture .
but a very important point that he does is , always , who you choose for one thing , decide not to do other things .
and so i compared what i would expect , and what i was expected to do , and what i was expected to do .
we have fuel fuel and third generation , and third generation , that will have become a much higher amount of increase , like fuels , or different kinds of particles .
we &apos;re going to study whether we &apos;re using carbon footprint , which could be easily brought down to the fuel , convert co2 to fuel to the process .
but more recent is a little bit weird in my life , and my career has happened to me to rethink my relationship with this work .
is it logical that somebody should be afraid of doing the work that he feels about ?
i say it , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here -- it &apos;s very likely that my greatest success is behind me .
and then there were these moments -- the part that i never forget -- she said that there were moments of moments where they almost missed it .
rs out of all the time , for you , despite all this , just for the fact that you have the mere human love , you have the mere human love , to be there .
and yet , the burning of coal of one of the main reasons for global warming is the most remarkable clean force that you see here , it changes everything .
you can be moved to your hand , you can see each other , you can detect your movements and you &apos;ve got a screen and you can see it .
these are some kids who come up with a media lab to the media lab . i could get them to try and try and do a video of it .
that &apos;s a network of a network that is actually a kind of forum , where where you &apos;re going to be hit and discuss online .
and based on these networks that have done all the popular experiments , there &apos;s a scene that i &apos;d like to do a moment that i want to be connected .
one of the things that you do , if you make the full amount of power with water , that &apos;s enough pressure , i think , so 40 and a half .
because if you just read about it , it &apos;s not the same thing , it &apos;s not the same thing as you &apos;ve seen yourself or seen .
this is a question that drives me very much as a designer , but also in the middle of the world , and in front of all of the things in the field .
that means for a child that &apos;s going to be able to do most of the time of the most time of his life with the age of stories .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened , that we &apos;ve shifted the responsibility for our memories and the production of our individual memories of our individual memories .
and depending on how i do , and when i do , , of course , it &apos;s a very different story , of course , as if there &apos;s a life of life .
because in the same way that we have been through this new species , the natural user , the natural user , for example , five times the average of our goal .
amazingly , it &apos;s that we &apos;re looking at something like this , which is actually a little bit of a time , but not that much .
this means that the whole western network of the city is that the city has always been , but the farmers never returned .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , write up in germany , it &apos;s best , in germany .
and just the things that you see , how do you know , how do you do , the way that you have , you need to go to biological systems .
so it doesn &apos;t take us to learn just reading grades and get the feedback on the piano or the right place on the piano table .
but i had the great fortune , very early , very early at 13 years old , and so i was at my school classes .
i was 17 years old when i went back to one of his courses , and i played the last four statements of the chopin , a new minister .
because while you &apos;re busy , you &apos;re not able to prove that you can &apos;t prove it , that there is no way , the man is happy .
so , we &apos;re not an isolated , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the subject battery and the subject and everything in between .
when steve lopez , new angeles of los angeles times , went through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man who was african-american , african-american , rough , wealthy , homeless , who played on a violin only two strings .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this unimaginable problem became for our cooks . how do we keep fish on our menus ?
a lot of arguments about it . the environment is the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish will be distributed , not concentrated . &quot;
no , i &apos;ve actually got out of this fish , because , in fact , i swear to god who tasted fish after that conversation after chicken .
it &apos;s romantic art , the way you know , the better you learn your fish , you know the fish more .
they made a 11,000 acres of acres of water -- hypertext , shrimp , shrimp , shrimp , shrimp -- and this is miguel and his company completely intact .
since then , in 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 25,000 hours of water , i &apos;ve spent about 25,000 hours of water in submersibles .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now about 26 billion tons of miles , probably 13 billion tons of tons , and that &apos;s simply not enough .
who can make a guarantee of what literally many billion times greater than any kind of waste of waste and other things that you can imagine ?
so the idea is pretty simple . the idea is to have to have the biggest gifted structure with 20 spaghetti tape , about three feet of tape , and building a marshmallow .
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , to create cars , to create video games and visual games .
of course , it &apos;s put it there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my alma , that &apos;s now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing that i &apos;m going to walk through is going to be hidden by this movement , that the finger is coming back .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
we know that happiness is mostly to be happy with people we like to spend time with people we like .
i think the most interesting result we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
the recognition will be slow in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening in other countries .
i have a plan for it . i want to convince you more people , including to all of you , to spend more time playing more time with play .
i call it the &quot; in life i &apos;m bad . &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
we ought to be able to do that that half of us spend an hour per day with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of real world .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re driven by the challenge , whether you &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both .
and maybe we &apos;re able to see it as a natural thing as a natural , coherent and useful , useful , and we &apos;re not going to rely on their presence .
the doctor for 79 diagnosis of my mother was in holiday , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
i came to the realization as a doctor that i was a goal to a goal , which was the goal of evolution -- not inevitably , just different .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with influenza for influenza in the cells of a nanotube .
well , in our town , in the volunteers who were volunteers , you have to be pretty early at the end of the day to be able to do it .
and when i found the world bank , he was in a very serious conversation , which was certainly one of the worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in her pajamas and she stood under a screen under a screen outside , while her house fell in flames .
not every day is going to give us an opportunity to save the life of one human , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with people who are working on their gender , which is their gender -- so people who don &apos;t have the average women or the female .
he says we should not be people , &quot; your skin color , &quot; but according to the property of your character , &quot; judge , &quot; and so on , you know , anatomy . &quot;
this whole outfit , including the jacket , made me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i was wearing all week .
and a kind of digital mexican in the night -- but as a computer scientist , a new kind of experience for everyone who wants to go to the top .
a lot of our friends thought that we were beautiful , we &apos;re pretty stupid , and that we could do it , and we would have all the images on the walls .
i feel that i was pushed underwater , and finally , somebody went down and kept my head up , and i can breathe . &quot;
and there &apos;s going to be so much the toughest representatives of the group of people who are involved in the world -- they &apos;re going to have -- they &apos;re going to come up -- -- they &apos;re all these guys .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the guy i know you &apos;ve found him .
and the little bit of energy takes over , and it takes off the herbivores and slowed down and down and down , and it turns out , and it &apos;s going to make a lot of noise in interaction with six .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the power of the stick on a stick , like we saw it in stuxnet .
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand in x , but we &apos;re going to make sure we &apos;ll sell every possible category in the movie .
they can put all with comments , send their friends , and start a conversation about what they feel when they look at these masterpieces .
so one of the intuitions that they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can be at the same time .
because if all of these things are made out of particles , and all of these particles are the rules of quantum mechanics , should not just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
so i &apos;ve suggested that governments create new surfaces that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
we pay new kinds of notes , but for progress , we need technology and laws and laws . and it &apos;s usually laws that come back to us .
now it turns out that even if you were to participate with the choices , even if you have more options , even then you have negative consequences .
think of it as a wall of the wall of waiting in front of your eyes , as he has to say that his life has been a single waste .
one day -- this is an actual record -- that &apos;s what was going on in my waste . can &apos;t tell if you &apos;re dead .
the question i want to ask you now is if you look at this exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go to it forever .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future and you realize that the future still lies in the year 2000 .
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is about the time of 2.5 billion years , where they were born right now .
now i &apos;m going to take all of these randomly chosen instructions , take all the programs out , and pick those up , and choose those who are the closest . &quot;
so i have a new generation of programs that evolved through combinations of combinations of programs that have come closer to the grasp than others .
i sat up in a 747 with marvin minsky , and he said , &quot; oh , look . look . look . look .
we now use these programs to make the computers much faster , so that we can do these processes even faster .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing .
i remember , i have to have been eight or nine that i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins fell around .
then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not always doing crazy because of the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
in nine people we &apos;ve been executed , one that we &apos;ve been ashamed of for innocent , who &apos;s been fooled and out of death death .
i believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
and i was with me that if i doubled my efforts to perfection , and never a mistake of a mistake , that the voice could fly .
two years later , i had service in the prison community in a hospital hospital north of toronto , and i borrowed a 25 year-old man , and i had 25 years old .
so if you take the system , as i &apos;ve been taught , and all the kind of data , it &apos;s been edited down , then at the end , there &apos;s no longer left .
and the transistor was a little bit of a little bit of a world that was being specialized by a world of static building building blocks into a world in which everything was going to be interactive .
and the official system works like this : if our goal is to maximize the common of our citizens , it &apos;s all due to the freedom of freedom of the individual .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could have all the phone you wanted to get , as long as he was from masters bell .
because it &apos;s 50 , it &apos;s been so hard to decide that it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose , that they put it in tomorrow .
and so when people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about themselves .
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years , and when we sequenced the project , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
this is what the future might look like with changes , can be accelerated today , with synthetic bacteria , with synthetic bacteria , and perhaps , and perhaps more inclusive .
these are the kind of thoughts that you can get to get nine o &apos;clock in the morning , drinking gin , and i don &apos;t want that .
they believed that creativity was a kind of differential compass that was made out of a distant , unknown source of the people coming out of a distant , unknown way .
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at all of you for you . everybody knew you had this kind of genius genius that helped you .
she knew she was only able to do one of these things at a moment , and that was -- in their words -- in their words , like the devil .
for me , the best living example of how you can do this is the musician tom &apos;s musician . i was able to interview him a few years ago .
so he &apos;s starting to go up to this old old , and this old thing , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to go from this song forever .
it could give you a strange , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and funny thing that was not quite tom .
and the most recent , and they have been spending a $ last dollar company , spent clean coal to promote clean coal , which is already a contradiction in itself .
so we set it up to the top top of the world , a significant transformation to try to get a more significant on the way to get the truth over coal .
we &apos;re starting to start in the world where we &apos;re going to start in two and a series of galaxies , and they expand and add a little more of the voice .
so , as you can see , my excitement is to develop new design opportunities that make better sense of how our brains and bodies work .
and , then it was also about , okay , who are we , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to say ?
a project that i did with the ted project in switzerland itself was that we wanted to create an optical premise or optical tweezer .
and then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought they were , there &apos;s different lights in the room .
and the machines that do this kind of thing , they &apos;re quite expensive , they &apos;re kind of expensive , the cheapest , they go to the least , the cheapest euro .
it &apos;s about how to study people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and create them for a more fundamental experience .
and that &apos;s , of course , where you start and look and look and say , okay , now i just look inside the inner self .
and as we see things , what we look at and how we sort of repair ourselves against our environment so that we can think about it .
even today , if you were invited to eat in china , you would be expected to be the same as long as long as you look at the toilet .
imagine if for example , your wife is sad when you were rowing , and you come with 50 rads .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you look at italy , like the people in italy , in the way that the people in the high bow put in the car .
now , from the german german to translate into english , there &apos;s more knowledge , because if you go to poetry , it &apos;s about poetry or even poetry .
i &apos;m going to have more experience experience of life than today , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to do a lot more of the palette in the world , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more on emotions and emotion and emotion than today .
but don &apos;t think about the lie as you may have heard , when people say nobody has the intention to build a wall .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him who &apos;s the most beautiful in the country ?
and i went to berlin in the middle of the 80s for berlin , because i wanted to make renewables , and they didn &apos;t have it .
and what we &apos;re designing is basically , in fact , it &apos;s just made of louder steel masses of big power stations , where the wave is all over europe .
well , i got a few people in the company . no one could give me a proper answer . until finally , with the senior biologist biologists .
they look out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything they &apos;re seeing , you know , , you know , these density of channels and these density , lush march .
we should call them what it is , a pharmaceutical industry , an industry , an industry that &apos;s rapidly enabled these kinds of environmental capital , which allows that production .
we can take a step further , and then we get the data and then see the data , and see that the usual suspects and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if i just want to give you a little bit of reference , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at it all with the topic ? &quot;
and since it &apos;s neither video games nor video games , there was still the whole imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we found that we were in the field , and we started -- what we were doing to the company , which was actually starting to slow down .
this is the thought that i &apos;d like to give you to the journey . fail is an alternative , but is not . thank you .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s take the price back -- let &apos;s take a new barrier , and this barrier corresponds to co2 .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to grow per unit of energy .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story , which was the rebel , and a terrible tale of vaccine , and brought it into connection .
we don &apos;t believe in a pile of documents that gives us data , and i understand that , and i think that &apos;s what we all do .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a credible disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works .
so , in this way , you can see that no time ever moves anything . as long as i &apos;m here , there can be nothing in my sleeve .
these are two very different units of the self , and the most important self , and the two of them , and the two of them , are part of the heart of happiness .
patient b clearly suffered more . his favorite rate was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient b , and more .
why ? this picture is pretty accurate , why i think games are so essential for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
the desire is to ask , immediately to do something , to master , to master , with believing that we have an educated hope of success .
the reason is , when we play , we &apos;re actually happier about working hard than if we can relax or not do anything .
so , they invented , according to television , according to a national strategy , a national strategy , and on one day , you would eat food . the next day you would play .
today , you can have a sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
play has creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about production of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and therefore , my favorite point , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution , and collectively play , while we have the creativity of creativity and the wonder .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case the sperm wears a y , which is the x chromosome of the higgs chromosome .
a lot of journalists were calling me the question : &quot; what are you going to do , who are you going to tell us , who tells us whether you &apos;re talking about it ? &quot;
it seems like our culture is kind of a pragmatic stance : &quot; good , we need to move somewhere , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones that they are without the rest of the rest of the country .
but before i show you what i have in this , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is , i &apos;m obsessed with seven-year-olds .
i think that the remarkable thing about what &apos;s happened last years is that we &apos;ve created from a physical world to a digital world .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for long-term 2012 and yet , and it &apos;s as a form of connection to community .
so i have a company that makes design and animation , so experimental is absolutely a complex part of what we admire in the art world and pay attention .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we have achieved some things .
first , we have the insurance companies in the doors , and they actually get a device , and they can actually communicate a device that he can communicate with -- stephen strangelove .
this is a cheap dragline , which we bought at the edge of venice , a little bit of the stuff and a few things out of the hardware store and the house .
armstrong krishnan over us and then , in december , we &apos;ve honored us to be honored as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of that i mentioned was .
and then we were looking for more searching , and we were trying to bring this to the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
i needed someone who could go down in my head , someone who could really help me understand what they call the &quot; aaaaaah . &quot;
according to that , it was the first time in january , and it &apos;s since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- for 900 million of these things -- there was 900 million volumes of this film .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince you , if you want to build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with an area of at least 1,000 miles .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the causal .
i &apos;ve done a survey recently with 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that are a typical american in power is a typical one day .
from the people who stayed there when they were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences , which is the offer of more and more choices with it .
but the crux of the supermarket today , which is the typical supermarket in the world today , and they &apos;re just 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a pot .
my first memories are from this boat -- that &apos;s connected to the engine of the engine that &apos;s clapping by every wave on the front , the long and empty horizon .
and the women came with their stories of men who don &apos;t change change the change , angry and angry kids , and they were caught between two worlds .
i &apos;ve gone out of my neck now to know that , yes , the world , but not as you do it .
it &apos;s a group of concerned , which has written a very detailed report , which is an answer to the most successful , which is an answer to the main community .
do we really believe that we have to reach what we need to do without improving an institution that can affect all of us ?
so as fast as fast as the most successful progression , we could go into a taxi and be in 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
this has never been in history in history , this kind of notion of growth of growth , which is the scale of all the few years exponentially .
in fact , the droplet of the crime grew up for the growth of the clinical composition faster than others , and more chemicals from the outside and more chemicals .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in traditional sense .
now , of course , the chance to be very small at random chosen , is that they &apos;re just a number of evidence , so they &apos;re probably not going to do this .
there is , &quot; this plane is made out of an aircraft &apos;s surface , which works together to make their flight safer . &quot; doesn &apos;t you mind ?
one more or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
one night , i was staying on a long time , and i thought , my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have to have a ride .
we bring our students all of these technologies , with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough time in business , as that i can give you a bit of my own wrong word to give you a little bit of this .
in my inbox , i learned the origins and the tail , every branch of a artery , every branch of each artery , which is from the aorta , obscure and ordinary .
there &apos;s a lot of talk about this , especially when you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that had only 14 patients a night .
they will confirm it because the evidence , as you can see in a previous form , are not like the evidence that you would like to describe the evidence .
we have to deal with the bowery separation of death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dancing and art .
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be its experience of your child &apos;s experience very differently than it would have been .
dan gilbert has done a big deal of this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things depends on what we compare .
it was taken in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as alien material , and so we ended up having a cell with a new chromosome .
don &apos;t you have a fear of your whole life , and never create a book in the world , that anyone in the world is interested in ?
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that you &apos;ve all seen this kind of performance in your life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be very much of anguish if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning of the most extraordinary aspects of your existence .
i think the molecular biology in general now , which is very generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so forth .
so , of course , that &apos;s how crazy it may sound in my talk , because we &apos;re moving physically in not protected , virtual worlds , after the model of the system .
now , you &apos;re going to ask , why do all the designers begin to deal with such as such as such as natural , interactions and so on .
so if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a short story , then we &apos;re moving from the third to the fourth , or financial standards .
that is , from the local village , it has become a global village with the same principles , of course , but also the total transparency .
that means we &apos;re just going to see our vision before we see it , and that &apos;s back to the back of our shelves , to say , okay , okay , okay .
we have only taken for two years of phosphorus and it &apos;s already been brought in a lot more uranium around the world &apos;s atmosphere than in all plant plant plants .
so if all the fingers in time and right now , like it &apos;s in the notes , it comes out , then notes notes , that sound like music .
only if you take another example , so if you &apos;re going to make the a haystack bigger , then you don &apos;t need a reason to do it .
it &apos;s certainly going to be a body body , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you &apos;re going to know , it will be .
and all right , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet a little bit crazy , and you can have a vision .
now , he goes to tell me that it &apos;s such a beautiful system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
and we bow around the corner , and we got the most incredible view , thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of hunters , an eye literally sold as far as far as the eye goes .
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success on their predators in their predators .
you see , we &apos;re surfing the first time , as if it &apos;s really a web , not only from side , but a lot more abstract .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and exploring the deep sea .
we had to do all that at the time . when we read a book , we took the description of the author and projected them on the screen in our heads .
and what happened was something interesting to me , because what i was fascinated by jacques jacques shows was the thought of an entirely unknown world on our planet itself .
anyway , that part of that , to do with curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
because we did all of these with only 10 to 12 people who worked for years , and sometimes we were two to three months of sea .
so , again , i stood back with a little team , and we were called &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before .
that &apos;s why you have to depend on those sources , you have a way to have a way that you have energy in times , if you &apos;re not available .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward .
and we start by taking the waste , which already exists , which is in these pools , or in these reactors , and that &apos;s our transportation system .
so this is what was a problem for these reactors , which is what we &apos;re putting in and it &apos;s going to dramatically reduce this process as the process .
rs : well , we need one of these metrics , the things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then use 20 years to use .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is everything that it takes to bring us from a &quot; dream &quot; moment .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the land that they live on .
and i was amazed to get on resistance on resistance , to the resistance of what is the most effective action in the public health system in human history .
now , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody &apos;s going to a lagos morning in lagos , and i &apos;m going to los angeles , right now , in the moment he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he goes and picks up a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to come up with one of these pieces of light tonight .
if you go on this path , where and magic and magic universe and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s definitely not so stupid , and it &apos;s not the skin , just to talk to us a few minutes . &quot;
they don &apos;t care , because he was with a memory attack ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to get .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that &apos;s slightly different from a human self . time has very little impact on this story .
i have the impression that when we &apos;re doing a holiday , it &apos;s very often called the case , which is what we &apos;re doing in the service of ourselves in the service itself .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that teaches them not much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
now , when we talked about a couple of weeks ago , she was talking to me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this gallup survey .
if you play , you see some nuances here that are going up to top of the eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism , the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied why we &apos;re better in play than in real life .
we trust that somebody has spent time with us that the rules are honored , that we have the same goal and we have to stay the same way to it .
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
and imagine i &apos;ve even dreamed of a child &apos;s child with dr. p. , and so trying to stop this practice without success .
they were just told that the student and that these are the students with the note enough , and they &apos;ve taught them something and they &apos;re treating them .
and as we talk about bacteria , you know , every one of us in our gut has more bacteria than the cells in the rest of our body ?
and i call it a little term -- the new development that isn &apos;t just natural , but led to us as a function of the decisions that we do .
play is a key game , and it can take a lot of shapes , some of which are quiet some of which some kind of quiet , curious , curious -- maybe to discover that .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore , and interact with it , and the unexpected twists that we form are the real biofuels of creativity .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in the middle of 1979 , at the same time , exactly the same moment , in the same moment , every one baby -- okay .
and what they were doing was a transformative concept , and they managed to deliver it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
and as you all remember , our founding fathers refused to be the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy were taken in the bottom of a very supportive concept of anatomy .
and of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the similarities , we need to start asking to question why we sustain certain divisions .
i love to find an opportunity to find a different kind of crazy outfit , wearing crazy outfit , and too recently , and too , recently , too .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do a few years ago .
but for two weeks , we have programmed , we went to the center of venice in venice , my kids were involved , my dog , and we created this .
about three or four years ago , i got a call in the middle of the night , a call from that teacher , woman , who said , &quot; i have to see her .
now , if we &apos;re going to do that , the systems and the valves and the valves control , then we can actually create a lot of problems with loss .
and i called them , and i know their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and if you manipulate the speed of this web , you know , you &apos;re actually able to crack the layer of rotor and even explode the centrifuge .
so the idea is , to show that brands are part of life , actually , to bring it to the film ?
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective &quot; because that &apos;s got a negative mutation -- but you know how to develop this ?
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth everybody &apos;s worth , some really familiar brands .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that these categories really make something positive , in contrast to &quot; fighting smell and moisture . &quot;
well , there &apos;s magic brands , and there &apos;s brands , these things that come and go and go , but one of those things that &apos;s going to come , but a brand , the brand is a very strong thing .
that means that every atom at the same time is at two different places , which is that the entire piece of metal is two different places .
but you could go to a completely new place , building a completely new building block , and then the laws of the law would be able to support it like that , and not give it to you .
unfortunately , sometimes even children who are trying to find their parents who are trying to find their parents in some cases since a decade .
so what is it for an idea to make that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition for new people ?
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them and ask them to clap when they &apos;re willing to be willing to take gary &apos;s &apos;s supply .
i got a ticket because i &apos;m not on the top of the day , but there &apos;s a lot of disability who don &apos;t have a very good drive to drive .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re hardly on the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
i put it with my former predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because using the camera was in the process of planning .
we were later told that when it was about the normal channels , it took over two years , and it would have cost about two million dollars .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in the year 2000 , and people were often talking about what would happen in 2000 .
so if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , then we have a pretty good picture about how they do this .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it into sounds , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also can continue to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because you get out of a series of millions of programs that have done the job .
we bring our kids closer and closer to the natural world , and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
she took me out , and she said , &quot; look , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t know . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old south , and i have a brother who is a year older , and a year younger sister .
how it would feel to live in a world where the german state people have made people , especially when they were a lot of jews .
and then the woman sat down in front of me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very evocative . &quot;
and every year we ask the students to create businesses , products , products and services that can affect life within a decade of people .
and then their pupils expand , they get hit before the head , then they look down and they &apos;re hard to tell their stories .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
we want the world of creators , the inventor , who encourage musicians , because this world , in which we live , is this interactive world .
now there are some among us that forget that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of the animal , &quot; &quot; really different possibilities of his mine . &quot;
this is a people who don &apos;t distinguish cognitively between the colors and green , because the most violent the forest is the forest of the forest that people depend on .
this tribe , the most famous , have 17 varieties of dna that they all recognize at large distance in the forest , which are sort of like our eyes as a form .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the library of congress and it &apos;s in a field of 300 .
and that &apos;s something that the complexity that people use , it grows and its use for the user and the use of the user .
if people have freedom , every one of us is about to do things that maximize our primary and no one has to decide for us .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions of whether this means all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you , and i &apos;m not going to get a good note in my class .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
and i have explained that we might be able to create a new form of explosion in which there might be massive new organizational centers based on this digital design .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
and what &apos;s wrong with the creative process is that you can make us insecure about the standard of mental health -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s this , there &apos;s a distance that i talked about -- the psychological construction , which protect you from your work .
so that &apos;s kind of sad for the kind of time , because that &apos;s not exactly what it does , which is what they actually did , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
another thing about the united states , which also has to do with this kind of high-tech thing , is the most powerful , which is pcr , complicated word .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap yet , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s very common .
and if you want to make good decisions in the society , and you want to join yourself in society , then you want access to knowledge and technology .
and this wealth of the virtual reality , which is that they have needed the people in the pre-industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
and as you can see , this is a very powerful area , and you had to kind of navigate , from island to island to get food .
that means that instead of remembering us , we have more raw , more common , more common patterns of memories of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
it &apos;s very direct advertisements , and it &apos;s not for the company puma , but that they &apos;re now helping this company to make these products successfully .
it was on a tour of my beloved old teachers at my loved old teachers , professors , who was a famous professor , a well-known professor , a famous professor , and the professor of the professor here in northern africa .
i was told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral sense , that &apos;s because we should try and use it , and then we should try to replace it through the most successful , though .
and that &apos;s that it &apos;s that it &apos;s that you know that it &apos;s actually known that it actually knew that it was related to the fire , but that it can &apos;t tell you .
and if you have this premise in front of your eyes , you understand the logic , with which we experience this happiness , to improve our world .
it looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have any free free , can be moved for the actions , and the claims of responsibility , and therefore , it &apos;s a lot of time .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , i &apos;m very , very touching , because many , many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve lived with .
as big as a battery would have to be , so you have an island in 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to turn the elder off .
that our system also has an energy system , because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent of the time , and it doesn &apos;t work in the other things .
and many discussions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years for the last 30 years .
we came to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email in that nathaniel was interested in the state of mine .
well , after i chose government &apos; government , i realize that the people who are doing most of their time are &quot; people who are in the world . &quot;
that &apos;s why , because you just look at these kinds of websites in this way , you can look at the same way that you can look at the same way .
but the measure of it was very nice , and people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do that .
it made me realize that this kind of thing that is that you could use these kinds of predatory schemes , and that &apos;s what your consciousness can do in the vehicle , in those other forms of existence .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve got to be a director of a director , as well as a director , to be a leader , or something like that .
well , the exact exact relationship between a solar system and the electricity system and where the other consequences are , there are some questions , but not very much .
so the key thing is that instead of a part of the wing , the one percent that is a percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the most sustainable .
and we should use the power to take reduction on the way , the less we &apos;re going to be the less , the less it will be , and the temperature will be .
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can make it fixed for 60 years -- think of a column -- that you bury , without the whole complexities .
bill , i think for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope you &apos;re going to be true . thank you very much .
the average rate for most of them is about 30 times , creating half of them , which is half of them , but not much , they &apos;re better than the adults .
drinking water , rainforests , oil , gas , gas : they disappear , and that &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we &apos;re going to go .
now , what i &apos;m constantly hearing is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing that is wrong .
it &apos;s not about rice engelbart , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s time to understand what that means .
as you can think of happiness , very different from how you think and whether you think about it , or whether you think about it yourself , or whether you think about it yourself .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting investigation that we &apos;re showing people more after we have played with them , even if they had defeated us .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the old greek forest , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people that we love to preserve , but they &apos;re also willing to get out of it , and they &apos;re good for it .
you have to separate two things : to be one of the medical fact , to be an industrial fact , and to be a social opinion about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
but they also have a mystery for our future , a future where we have to adapt to rising challenges of creativity , through larger creativity and agriculture .
so gender is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be spread across the whole range of the range .
and one of the things that i found really interesting was the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operate in the world .
and since you &apos;ve heard of me as the woman who &apos;s sitting there at ted in her underwear -- that &apos;s what i found a few things .
we found one for them , we took them , and we took them , and we gave them eight , because it was necessary to their family .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is part of the most powerful part , the most powerful part , it &apos;s made of thousands and thousands of acres .
and if you &apos;ve heard that the most violent of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the most important is a science for itself .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing as this -- fun at the beginning , a little hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
what i want to do is , is a film about 10 inches of marketing , marketing and advertising , where all the movie is going to be funded , marketing and advertising .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every ad interface we &apos;ve talked about , their customers of their customers .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms from those of the atoms are still there , and they move at the same time at the same time .
so if a single atom can be at the same time at two different places , this piece of metal can be two different places , why not it ?
i loved to go to this business , but at a time , i asked myself , well , how is it that you never buy anything ?
it also puts me into excited about the great product that i &apos;m doing , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be with interest with interest .
it &apos;s not very scientific about this -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and the patients , families , family , relatives , like this ?
and you could have connect them with government services if these were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to state services .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like some other , which we find in our field , is a kind of a straight curve .
so , the computer , computer , the computer groups , and so on , are all our responsibilities mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
then she said , &quot; next to me , you know , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; even though it falls hard to do the right thing .
it was very quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;re ever going to be killing ourselves for the systematic of people .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there is no doctors , there are 25 percent of the population of health and 1.3 percent of the staff of health .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online for the new challenges , and to do what it needs to do .
and when i was going to see her chest chest , i could hear a kind of sound sound on both sides , which told me that she was tone-deaf failure .
and then a day of a day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun came out , and i might be able to feel better again .
and i went back to the same sort of darwinian thing , and self-doubt , i felt free and went to work on the work until it came back and again and again and again .
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
and then i &apos;m going to take the same patient with the same patient , doing it , and i &apos;ll give you a little bit of a breath , and i &apos;m going to give you a little bit of a breath and there &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of that story , and all of the time is suspended with contempt .
the u.s. intelligence agency , two months ago , two months of the swiss master &apos;s council of mr. jain here , and there were a million million dollars that had been broken down .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this plant here .
they didn &apos;t stop to be on sioux when they were taking a bow and arrow , when americans stopped being americans , when they were watching a horse and a horse .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute in that we &apos;re asking our child at a gymnasium , we ask ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ?
the reason that i felt worse with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what &apos;s good for a good couple of jeans , went up .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
we find all sorts of species here that have a second chromosome , or a third of the time , any thousands of characteristics in only one second to a species .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back , and you have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
we will turn it home , and we expect to collect the first data in june or july , and we &apos;re going to continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a kind of verbal notation , again , the debate about the value of science and engineering in such boundaries . it &apos;s easy to reject it .
because it makes sense as much meaning as anything that i &apos;ve heard about , when it was about trying to explain the absolute nuts of the creative process .
but then he became older , and he was quiet . he told me that he was going to a jump in los angeles , and he changed everything for him .
and in this case , we have three main approaches , and i can use it , and i can use it to cast color in the middle where they mix .
and you tie them out on top , and then you put them in these clouds , and then i put them on the onion , and then i put the lights on and then brought it to the light .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re also going to have a lot of debt , and then we &apos;re also very well connected , so that stop people can be involved .
the second aspect is that we &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to speak very , very much , very , very quickly , to speak , even though we &apos;re using a language language .
but for me in the field of interactive media , as a particularly impressive thing , we have evolved in our biological memory , the ability to think .
so you have to engage with what is meant , and not just change it , that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s supposed to be better .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this case , is actually not , it &apos;s actually not , but there &apos;s a lot of mass that &apos;s going on here .
in fact , the way that i can do a certain kind of goal , what can i do a certain kind of goal , or how can a user be more effectively effective , efficient , efficient and turbulent a goal .
and because they &apos;re working much harder than we do , and because they only live three or six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in energy consumption , in the energy consumption .
and then there &apos;s also , in fact , whether you &apos;re going to learn it , you know , it &apos;s passive or you can also talk about it until the musical speaker .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experience and the idea of music , then it &apos;s going to be about another possibility , so to get the sound .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first set of the world is wrong , as if you have to adopt the opposite without evidence .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of map the electric coverage of the island in the scale one to three very closely .
so , in discussion , in arguments , we &apos;re always trying to do this kind of thing that &apos;s going on , which is , you know , they have a little net , which has nothing to do with ours .
okay ? there we were , and we fought through the wetlands and i went through and i struggled , and i got mud to my knees , and miguel is holding in silence .
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like any of those . i don &apos;t like them . i don &apos;t like them .
jacques cousteau came up with our fascinating shows with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of wonder that we &apos;ve never imagined before .
and i &apos;d come up with my father until finally , until finally finally , in buffalo , new york , had come to realize , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we have a little bit more money with the film .
so , i set up a company , together with my good friend stan winston , who was at the time of the best of the world &apos;s best , and she was called &quot; digital . &quot;
you go up into those capsule , then you put up into this dark , hot environment , where there &apos;s no hope on saving , if you &apos;re not making it yourself back .
and i wonder what you would choose because i &apos;ve been asking my friends in the last time , and they all wanted to go to the past .
this is the greatest time that we &apos;ve ever had on this planet , no matter what scale you &apos;re using : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , density .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , and they were all alike , no correlation , no correlation , no connection .
it &apos;s the most salient self , which is the doctor &apos;s office -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt when i &apos;m doing it here ? &quot;
you know jerry oxytocin , where there &apos;s &quot; the &quot; aaaaaah . &quot; they have the astronauts , the scientists , the most educated and only together can save the world .
and when i was in the next decade , i &apos;m sure , for two things , that we can create every instruction future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
i would like to use it : not the most powerful of its species , and not the most sustainable of his species , but the one who can adapt to the best .
there &apos;s the usual one . the typical one . but not the normal . and would you want to know this poor person , gray person , if you really want to be ?
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually the largest part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are pretty much the same .
i think we would all be able to understand the mood of everyone who has to be able to understand , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve immortality through my work .
and by the way , we wander and we aggregate and mix so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for the evolution of evolution , for evolution .
so think about it if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , the gender of your child , but you &apos;re going to be able to make a genetic impact that can heal and prevent disease .
it &apos;s not going to take long until the reality will be that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
this is also also a little bit of the time that &apos;s on your hip , as you can move on your hip , as you move forward in that pretty much , and very natural gait .
a place where women do lead to the sex , with sex &apos; hello , and the game is defined the day -- where fun is a serious deal .
we know them as &quot; love war war , &quot; because they have kazakhstan , also , sex , with sex partners , and rules such as conflicts and social science .
and they make a few tests and figure out that instead of doing it instead , they &apos;re in their minds , in fact , in their minds , and they have a y chromosome .
and one part of me asks , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be done in the future -- could be made visible ?
i meet all kinds of cool people ; my dollars serving a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s shopping to my own personal experience .
and he again drew back to the first time of his family in his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what was a feeling on the parking lot .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , they had to know me , turned it into a box of anarchy , and was put into my hands .
so over the movie , we had more than 500 companies who were up and forth , and the &quot; no &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
and so i see myself as one of the other experimental music , with most of the experimental logic to add the complex ideas together .
we gave him a little push , we could push it in the same time , and not vibrate -- something that is only in quantum mechanics .
and the director of congress came to the stage , and he said , &quot; professor &apos;am , i thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
and these scientists just documented the different themes that these ceo have been doing , and how much time they spent decisions with the issues .
now , if you calculate it , people buy six times more glass , and they had six to the choices when they had 24 to choice .
so the very unexpected , creative software , totally unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has in the audience and in the audience .
can i give you a little bit of a bug in your life , which is courageous every wave of any wave of the wave , all the wave of the engine , the long horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee ?
personally , i personally believe that it &apos;s easier to create a place , as a place , because you don &apos;t have to take trade-offs with the ideas in your head .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik mcchrystal , noticed something else , and that was that the inhabitants were holding the sidewalks off , right before these parts .
so an app that was written in a few days , and then moved from the ground , is a kind of shot on the front of the tree on the government .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock &apos;s cattle ? &quot;
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of the government function in a way that can actually do something that can actually cause them to sustain society .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we are not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers who are paying taxes and receiving services .
now , if i want to record a different technology , let &apos;s say , let &apos;s say , this is an irrational scale , which is very irrational , in the form of a flat line .
so if somebody else wants to do a hundred million copies of my business , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
we believe that because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is , is this : does a human man deserve to die for him to die ?
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists in my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear you hear . &quot;
and most of all , i want to take those of you who see that as well , just say , don &apos;t you lose the goal of your eyes . don &apos;t give up .
yes , it &apos;s a percent of dry percent , two percent , two percent , and we fight about 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there are hope .
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean drinking water every day -- whether seawater , messy water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per liter .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which many of my colleagues say , but total nonsense .
eight years ago , i was on the media lab , and i started to explore this idea , how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
but the thing about it is that you can &apos;t get rid of it , because you &apos;re of course in the human gut , of course , of course , of course , with the name of your gut .
and the eastern government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the course of the establishment of our enlightenment , they were forced to pull in settlements .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience of a magazine to read a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium of scale .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , that if you &apos;re thinking about it , because we don &apos;t buy them .
so to buy new jeans after the age of the old age , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and they have to overlap with others to build smaller amounts of water to build these .
in each step , we have created these pieces in the surplus so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
and after a very short time , all of the characteristics of the species had lost and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve been given to the cell .
we now have , from our discoveries all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most profound of the future .
we &apos;re getting human light away from people to improve , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who haven &apos;t been there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that has ever been completed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that exist less than one more than a second second of the universe -- and that &apos;s up to 600 million times in a second .
everything you need to do is to look at the spectra of really great minds from the 20th century , who died and dying from your own hand .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent west and directions of india , where there &apos;s a profound decline of the oxygen in the ocean .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s pretty young people , but the only thing that one thing which is really common is this fascination is this fascination in technology .
now , it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and there &apos;s enough energy coming out there , then you get there .
what &apos;s exciting about this is , when you look at this , this new society , these emerging societies , are very much of a lot of mechanisms , principles and engineering model from the ground .
as you knew in the village , who has what and when , with whom and when , this is what happens today about this expansion of self through these mobile devices on global scale .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , when i may have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve developed so long in advance how long i &apos;ve been in advance .
and now , from this soul , you think that somehow it &apos;s kind of natural , in this 30-year nature , it &apos;s called the latin , it &apos;s in the latin , which is , in latin africa .
and the most common or the solar system or whatever it is , in the rule of a system or a system or a system , which can only be in small quantities here .
so from that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from this point of view to the idea , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable right now .
so we started talking about music , started by bach beethoven , summize , and all the other people , and all the rest of the rest of them , all of the way down to the back of the street .
it &apos;s a river that runs all the things that the rivers tend to do today , to lead them to the chemical pollutants , flow of sound .
one drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love of love , as well as romantic .
now , when we move forward , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main causes of accidents that people should be concerned about .
and my nose would always put in a book in a book , which my thought of my mind in other worlds , and my very deep way in my head in my head , celestial curiosity .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the coastal oceans , is as rich as rich as we can really imagine it .
after the &quot; titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my credit as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice , and for a while . &quot;
because of different successes in the brain , through other forms of information , through new methods , there are lots of services , there are lots of services that make a few of the resources that are reduced to 90 percent .
rs : well , the real spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
but this is keeping me awake at night -- one of the things that i wake up at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as much as now , never , never before .
and i can tell you that we are now living in an epidemic of fear , like i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never seen again .
we have to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time machine , we &apos;re going to be happy to have this .
the second trap is sensitive to experience and memory : basically it &apos;s being between happy in his life , and being happy about his life , or happy with his life .
and the third is the most unfortunate , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being without breaking its meaning .
there &apos;s a major self that lives in the present , and the present knows , and the present is able to experience the past , but basically the present .
if i tell you that someone has his life as eight percent of the music , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his own self .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study or whether they want to study or whether they want to study , so we have to do this discussion pretty soon .
he &apos;s called dr. strangelove . a computer scientist whose name , as you can think , is the most americans not correct , so he was called dr. p. .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive , to survive and to survive , is based on the fight of the human spirit , through conflict .
and secondly , as a species we have , our environment is so versatile that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to us , and we adapt to them .
and so far , as far as the isolation of the species , as a species of distant planets , there will be insulation and the changes of the environment that might produce evolution in natural ways .
the same technology that can make the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses not just protect themselves , but also to serve the immunity against other viruses .
we &apos;re going to have a process that &apos;s going to require 100,000 years , and we can do it for a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
now i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine , because if you can imagine the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
where i experienced most of the excitement , the south african prize was the last year in the last year , whose gender was asked to be asked to question in berlin world in berlin .
they were the notion that people who had the political power should have this political power , because of the most violent of the land of the great bang to the father to the girl and so on .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , a lot of them will be interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a fundamental world .
they went away from explanations , and meadows things , like a supernatural concept of power , back , where the transmission on a very uncomfortable feature is based on divinity .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i talk a dream &quot; a way .
what i know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea that the united states is leaders to make sense of democracy .
the icebergs around me almost 60 meters from the water , and i could only wonder that this was a snowflake on a different skydiving year , year after year .
and my friends , who make big , gigantic design , say that the reason why their movies are so successful is because they &apos;re so successful .
the first thing that i saw was this idea was that her favorite rate was two separate , but it &apos;s got the morgan pages -- the morgan side of a brand &apos;s brand .
instead of just getting there , it &apos;s just going to be quiet , it &apos;s kind of like it , like it was like this -- like this -- like a scream and together .
there are many of the entrepreneurs who would love in america , especially in a place with a free trade , and there &apos;s a lot of people who like to live there .
so , one day , i decided to go to the police store , and i asked the ladder , &quot; this model , &quot; this model , &quot; is that that model that they really offer all of these possibilities ?
so the people who decided to participate in this way , the more possibilities they have , the more they put it and choose fund .
in other words , unlike the 20th century of the 20th century , participation is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading or doing something new .
so the things that make a realistic look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday life .
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of them -- maybe only most of the electronic music , because we &apos;ve stopped listening .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country who write up and writing in their own communities every day .
now , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world we want to leave our children .
so the key is now where these communities are so close to the fact that they &apos;re determined to write the recipe for the whole community to the dna .
so , an organism , for example , could learn not to eat a specific kind of isolation , because she liked bad and made him sick , the last time he ate her .
i came to ted because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe far , but it &apos;s the justice .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost for solar power in india to 50 percent of the world &apos;s population -- in comparison , 17 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , a couple of weeks ago , that was a soccer star , which was used by germans , to make their own citizens .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , which i &apos;ve ever lived in the northeast of ecuador , is an amazing people who had been contacted in 1958 .
he went out to be outside , leaving his pants pants flowing down , and in his hand , and when the feces started to market nets , he shaped it into the shape of a given .
we can play our kids playing football , and we have our mobile phone on a hip , and our blackberry on the other hip , and our blackberry probably on our lap .
the reason is that it was all better than anything worse than anything that was worse for people to be able to do a pleasant surprise .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry , steve , you &apos;ve heard about it yesterday yesterday talked about how this expensive and heavy car car is not helping . it &apos;s a waste of money .
and we started creating pieces , starting with pieces of the five to 30 letters of the letters , put these together together to put these together together , to put them back together , until they put them back .
a process that has -- as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- in other words : in other words , everyone here -- not always always seemed to be sensible .
i talked loudly , you know , do you think , you know , you and me both , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
there are also some nice ways in education as well as languages , mathematics , or math , where we &apos;re going to give people the opportunity to be a very quick job and the result of the results .
you &apos;ve got to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something about the classic world , five hours , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , it &apos;s just an hour .
and that means that if we look , we can transfer existing input from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can draw this as a creator .
in the end of it &apos;s about 50 to 30 times of the time that we &apos;ve ever seen , so in the sleep , you &apos;ve noticed that it &apos;s less often less often than a day day day .
and through this kind of transmission , like with the metaphor of the fittest , but now not more a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a product of a matter of defense .
because in this verbal receiver , the smell of the flowers is not to smell of the flowers , which is only to be able to be able to be able to not hear , to be able to hear , not to hear , not to feel .
and then when this libertarian comes across the people , then it &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature , with nature that can only live , yes with soul .
and i &apos;m going to come back with nathaniel &apos;s music , whether in the walt disney hall , or in a row of row , because he reminds me of why i had become musicians .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a 3.5 foot of high trucks , which has to be under a three feet bridge , and then you can put it underneath it .
the other note is , if we use the technology technology , whether it &apos;s deployed in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
and fortunately , today , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds , the ones that work , as well as their approaches work , working for their pilots , can be able to work .
there &apos;s a phase that &apos;s called a science visualization , which is what &apos;s going on with various techniques to evaporate the warming , so that we have 20 or 30 years longer to give us a chance .
and from my perspective , the scientific method is to try to look at things , see if it works , if it doesn &apos;t work , if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul increases and vaccines talk about vaccines and , and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop .
and you know what ? when i say that , people will scream me and say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want .
and the distinction between the happiness self and the happiness of the self has been recognized has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two .
what that means is that if you were to meet somebody and you would tell them , oh , your father is a big , how much would you know about your size ?
what happens , obviously , is that money doesn &apos;t buy any food , but lack of money , you know , lack of money , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the world trade , that if we spend 10,000 hours with a match of any subject to the 21st , we &apos;re going to be answering it .
in a case , you might have someone who &apos;s got to be connected , and that &apos;s the gene of the y gene that we &apos;ve got to grow up at the stage of all the time , to grow into the testes .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually has a brain that has been exposed to a woman , as a woman who was born with testicles , and one of the things that was born .
it was always proven and over and over and over and over again , when people were coming to me , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
it &apos;s an active walk around the gray box , when a special configuration has been discovered , and even if that &apos;s the special program , which is trying to infect it .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i was directly interacting with things .
the fellow fellow rights for medical objects are not only people , but the light that seems to be the light that seems to you and the wind and the heat of the space .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the deep and strange and strange of quantum mechanics .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion in a place when there was a pause , said , &quot; paul , we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
and shortly after , at the 19th of january , they have voted with congress for a change of the constitution , to have a change of control that was special for special health care .
now , if you look at the extreme , the plans , the plans that are offered two fund , in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want it .
it turns out it &apos;s in the outer rainforests up and down in the northeast area , and the number of different kinds of magazines have different kinds of magazines up to high school magazines .
without the support of your husband , she was worried for a big deal by bringing it to court and was in her own case , and a greater big deal than she won .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew i needed several months to get them to find the different places for the puzzle of the puzzle .
in other words , they have found a way of creating evolutionary species that allowed them to do what they were giving , so that this information could be stored and copied .
in the next book , we plan an interaction where you used the video of the ipads , and through augmented reality , you can see an animation of dengue that appear on a plant before the house .
it is hard to tell us to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to move us to the process of truth and reconciliation .
finally , a society is not measured about how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the disneyland plague .
and i started with this bill , and the headline said , &quot; interpret , my arms , my arms black clients like a privileged , white , white , white . &quot;
how would it be about the oppressed , wherever you are , there &apos;s a voice to make a voice and make change for the first time ?
imagine life in a certain remote neighborhood , and you &apos;ve got a beloved people with clogged , and you know , and you &apos;ve got some of the people who have clogged , and you &apos;ve got to get rid of it in a more remote , which is about 200 feet .
that &apos;s what i sent you home , i &apos;m a silent voice in me , trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
so , i think of the x-rays of the kidney &apos;s toy , and when it wasn &apos;t , my colleague , my colleague at the top of the patient , was stuck in the lower right sector and called the surgeons .
and she works in a medical culture , realizing that people fill the system with life and when that is , then people make mistakes of time too time .
and last week in a meeting with dutch jazz , i asked one of the senior who asked the question of whether he could make it possible for possible to be able to die .
so , for example , take the example of this child in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the caribbean , they believe that they &apos;re in the belly of sacred snakes in the belly of sacred snakes .
he pulled the dog , and he would throw a container , and he took the skeleton of the dog , and he would have a nine-year-old , built a different dog , and he &apos;s going to get a different dog &apos;s dog on the pad on the pad .
one of them is a very good research , and the other one is a very good scientific research , which is a graduate student at the university of washington university , under a college university of the university of steve art .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of work , and again , and again , whether we should work or not work .
the chromosome is the chromosome in the cell , but only recently , we &apos;ve shown that you have a whole transplant of a pair of a pair of a pair of a pair of cell to the other .
but we seem to have this kind of call , but not just the writers , but the creative of all the backgrounds , they seem to have this reputation , mentally incredibly unstable .
somehow , i &apos;ve got to find a way to write a certain way in the writing of a safe distance between me and my very natural health response to the writing .
if the dumb divine genius , which you ask for the side , is to decide for a brief moment of wonder of wonder of wonder of your effort , and then , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of wonder .
and this is a little bit of the time , and when i put it in a direction , it &apos;s going to take the video forward ; if i put it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
here in the image on the upper left , you can see , you see , you know , you know , you see , you know , this is a kind of a school , which is basically a kind of school , a private school , a nonprofit institution , where everybody can get .
children , old , all kinds of people go to that , just to get out of it , they set up a lab , and look at what you can do when they &apos;re going on .
or what you usually understand under a lab that is so kind of conceptual machines , extremely expensive , extremely narrow , just for the educational , trained academics with a ph.d. and so on .
and then we don &apos;t do that , but that &apos;s what we do , but that is , i think , i think , quite well , that people are quite well taken out of this .
we all know that the interactive media is based on definition of definition , which is the denial of the linearity , and , of course , tells us that we now feel the linearity as normal .
and if i say computer games , they &apos;re probably very likely to imagine that any people in front of some cases , some people who are playing in their hands , and they &apos;re playing with each other in their hand .
if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i &apos;ve got to be able to look at my little friend here and see what it means , because what does it mean to look at the point of view , when is really something intuitive ?
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the highest , right ?
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of getting the risks , the other , if you just put fire in .
it &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and it &apos;s like the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and assuming .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , more convenient , wider , zoom , you don &apos;t just look at it or pray .
and in this community you realize that the most important thing is that you have to be aware of each other , because you &apos;ve overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain anything else .
so when i went back to turn my next film , &quot; avatar &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re having your team to respect and join yourself in return .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines that are , in fact , we could reduce it to 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time , we can see a slope about 1.3 .
he &apos;s still going to have been associated with his former stories , with the sex , but he understood that this is a very rare group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s going to bring it up .
none of them -- no offense , insisted , insisted , insisted , there , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we give billions of dollars to it , it &apos;s served .
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so far as far as we do , we feel guilty of something that we don &apos;t want to be guilty , i don &apos;t want to be unhappy .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule , which doesn &apos;t seem as good as the needle .
but also , because it turns out that we &apos;re using this whole time to play this whole time , actually , to change what we &apos;re capable of humans .
the most sophisticated species are designed to save the energy , saving energy , and working on top of the world , rather than that , so that players are able to play all over the world , especially in india , china , brazil .
maybe this is the concept of the concept that &apos;s just looking at what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix it , for every single one of a larger disability than the pathology of itself .
is it clear that we can pull out of it , and the mechanisms of a common bacteria can be able to produce the protein of the human genome , which is used to treat diabetics ?
in this vast decentralized symphony of the universe , life on earth is just a small dose of money ; the animal kingdom , like a single stroke , and the human life , a small kind of energy .
and the reason for that would be that , first of all , we &apos;ve been able to preserve a lot of genes that would have otherwise had a lot of genes that would have been otherwise , and it would be removed from the population .
i want you to imagine a little bit now , a portable robot that gives you a little bit of the skills , or a different one that helps you to come up and go back .
and the first thing that &apos;s going to do is to lead to the decline that you don &apos;t even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos -- and you &apos;re not sure to be honest .
but it usually takes up until you get to puberty , and your breasts grow and develop , but they don &apos;t get their period , until someone comes from here , that there &apos;s something different .
and only when he got 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he put it inside , that the doctors found out that he was inside female .
while we continue our science , we continue to move into a zone of awkwardness , where we need to recognize that the religious categories that we &apos;ve had , probably too simple .
one of the areas that we see in this is in our modern culture today , in the united states , are the fighting and the end of life .
while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons that i believe whether you believe it or not , you &apos;ve learned nothing new .
a while ago , it was that if you wanted to win a formula 1 , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver , and a good car .
so i came up with the need , just just a check , and instead , i put a check out , from which i didn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how to brush him .
so , that really got my interest and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
and i started with scientific literature , about how this aversion are built in southern afghanistan , and found that they &apos;re structured in what they &apos;re called , in what they were doing , and every single one of the things that they have .
i have a check in my pocket , and i &apos;d put in on the top of the top of the lung bank , which is a check -- a check in altitude , in altitude , to fund my battalion in the next year .
but i bet that it taught him to play a very valuable lesson with a very valuable lesson , which is the big things you don &apos;t just leave , and that you &apos;re staying at a point .
and what we looked at was whether the number of people who had been able to be able to do that kind of a childish plan , the design plan , the probability of whether it was more tomorrow .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and in different ways -- that they can just apply in their business .
and it turns out that if you make it that something feels very specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to get people to save more .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can actually capture , but i want to let it look like you could have done that on a photograph .
so every morning , i &apos;m going to get to my graduate school and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch , &quot; just like a little lettuce today , a little lettuce . &quot;
and it will allow people to measure from home to their blood pressure , sending it to their doctor and share it with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
there &apos;s this guy in the middle of the city of the city , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but for the citizens to adopt the citizens .
and because the government finally put their power out of us -- you know , &quot; we are the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , it &apos;s going to affect how this change happens .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and they started communicating these cells and exchange information , so that communities created from cells .
so these communities started evolving , so the level , on which evolution was happening , wasn &apos;t the single cell , but the whole thing that we call organism .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and he took a beer beer , and he took my sister and got me and walked into the forest .
now with all the digital devices that we have seven days the week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
think that a large percentage of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , the tv , the television cell , the cell phones , the cell phones .
if i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about making life full of opportunities .
let &apos;s go back to my world in medicine , which i feel much more comfortable , or maybe a little less likely for me to talk to you about it .
maybe i wanted to succeed and be able to take responsibility , that i was so , and so i would be able to worry for my patients without having to contact it .
if you think of &quot; avatar &quot; when you think about it , why are people so touching that way -- apart from the top of the fish , why they were so touched by the ground ?
so , i &apos;m going to take you to a journey today in a journey that i &apos;m going to take you through a journey , a short journey through , to try to understand what &apos;s actually lost .
progeny of the old farming civilization , the heart of the caribbean in the coastal gulf of columbia , and in the aftermath of the terminal , this people went back to a massive , massive , which is available to the ministry of the caribbean .
in fact , we &apos;re starting by a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new life and building .
and so we decided that it &apos;s the only way forward to the front of this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would actually wrap up scientific scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- the -- -- the most exciting , the people who succeed and apply to their projects and so on .
if you may just believe that you &apos;re a coin -- from a spectacular source of your life for a kind of time of your life , that &apos;s been passed on someone else , if you &apos;re done with it .
while they realized how to switch off the hands and go out and do it , they would actually learn how to do it , and move , in fact , to understand and change the challenges and change connections .
and it &apos;s got to be done with software , but there &apos;s also , you know , there &apos;s also a whole , there &apos;s a whole system that is going to do all sorts of things that are going to do all kinds of different things .
and this is what he &apos;s got to do , which is such a sort of macho , or something like that , so it &apos;s a little bit like this , and so he &apos;s got a lot of it , he &apos;s going to be doing a glamour , his house is sam .
because , as we said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also no chance to get there .
that means that when you know that , you know who you &apos;re looking at who you look like long , because i don &apos;t have a gun for what &apos;s going to happen .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours more likely to go home , but your employer , or anyone , will have a way of doing it with the four hours .
and if you put the people that if you put people together , if you say it would be better , you would not be there , you &apos;re going to be tuned and hostile .
and at that point , when you laugh , you realize how important this lies is , and how much time you need to experience something that artists can tell us very well .
and now you can just do , if you want to do something yourself , if you want to test something , if you want to test something , and especially if you want to test people happy , the courage to practice the lie .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that he &apos;s got the word again , because after all the time , you couldn &apos;t use the word , because all the left was bad .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to grow , so far outside the sea , you don &apos;t have the environment . &quot;
some people say you should not be working on insurance , because you may be lazy , so you keep eating , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the procedure .
but because this is not what &apos;s happening here , we can do it , and people like jenny can run over and messages of fear and illiteracy and growing of platforms as oprah and larry king .
but i think in this frame , and with the intention of making a real deception , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
from the point of view of the self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is so good as the first one , then it &apos;s almost as good as the head of vacation .
if people would take this particular seriously seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on your head , all that we believe , for example , in terms of color and so on .
so here we have a complete health system , on the young people who are learning , what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
this was dr. toland , a man i knew only from stories of my mother &apos;s stories , because i was , of course , very typical , to my birthday two weeks .
and most of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom and the wisdom that we need to make these decisions ?
we often talk about very young people with spinal cord , who are in the middle of their lifetime -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s , and the wheelchair is the only option .
i want to suggest that i &apos;m probably going to know some of the light patterns that are the most powerful , intelligent and more mature decisions to make their sexual relationships than some people i know .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go to the future if we have democracy to think about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies of what identity affects , and thinking more about relationships .
and finally , saturday : a new unique , unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world about one , without having to say a word .
it started with a question of aviation , which came to us and told us that spain and internet companies have a beautiful tradition of water to use water as part of architecture .
and one of the ideas that have been tested at mit in a nanotube was , imagine that these tubes , and the valves , and the valves , they open up and close .
but then the whole thing could be just a 3d cloud of plastic that you can approach and through , through which you can look through many , many , look at many , many directions .
now , for the first time -- and the campaign of obama has shown this -- we can get from the digital world , from the self-organizing forces of the networks to the physical world .
but tomorrow , it can tell us the next challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to the physical world .
i just want to talk to him , and i said , &quot; wait for a minute , i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all of the paralyzed people communicate with this devices ? &quot;
but if we can make it that an effective increase on a laptop is used by a laptop , it &apos;s used by one of the gray box , and then we &apos;re in the business .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world in a tedtalk , i knew , i knew , i knew i &apos;d make something a little bit different .
18 months ago , i was doing something else at google , and i went to do something with museums and art , and my favorite , which is now , i had green light .
i mean , it can sound strange about that that one thing is at the same time in two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed them .
and so , i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually just kind of brute objects that are together in a small room together .
we &apos;ve got six different flavors , or 24 different tastes , put together , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i would be more people standing and trying to try and try and try ?
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t for free , and it was my job to learn that the history was being tried to crush us , but we passed it away .
every dollar was reviewed and became more educated in other education and mathematics , no matter what we had to get out of . most of the time , the new stuff that came out of the second hand .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to get them to play any kind of game , to control their health better .
so they have either survived , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community would repeat more and more often by evolution .
it &apos;s this complexity that i think i think is driving us , not only to be open to all the bright ones , but the dark and the dark ones .
there &apos;s no distinction of technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears and injustice , and injustice .
so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could be the last six days , or the last six years .
they use the resources like the train , to put their computers with a football calculator , which allows them to monitor their entire communication of communication , their pups , to collect their pups .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took on the northern end of the night at the northern end of the day , when i walked down to the top of the day , and this man , a wonderful story , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to those distant goals of the earth , realizing that they &apos;re not removed at all .
they represent parts of the human imagination going back past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our own children are part of the geography of hope .
and of course , all of those are the most vulnerable virtual models of any kind of interesting part of the earth that has not only been taken through or satellite images and satellite images , but by collective memory .
and then they go to the business store to put a wooden stereo -- speakers , the blink , the radio , a radio , radio , regime , and in that one electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo facilities .
work -- we are blessed , as carl showed up , with technology that allows us to work every minute of every single time on the planet -- until the hotel hotel hotel .
it &apos;s a picture of the first run which is the entire route that the whole trip to the lhc , then , in a part of the lhc , to make an rain of particles on the detector .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world &apos;s work is the work that &apos;s going to be successful in my last book , right ?
because -- at the end of the end , it &apos;s like follows , centuries ago , in the deserts of centuries of people , in the deserts of the people who have died with holy dances and music that had been stopped for hours -- until dawn .
an interesting implication of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures to data , like colors like this , as you do with fluid .
i graduated in , and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project brought up , and that &apos;s the most beautiful thing , that &apos;s the most beautiful thing , that &apos;s the most beautiful thing , the most beautiful of michael potter , lemon thalis .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is there a little bit of noise for this , where there &apos;s a little bit of noise on it , where almost no matter what &apos;s going on ?
so if we go back to the realm of software , here &apos;s the first set line line , which was very abstract , where you had taken months to deal with these systems .
not to burn a little better , a little bit better , to lose it and to lose the whole materials and the whole materials for structure , but first of all , how do you do structure ?
at the time , you know , you have a very rich knowledge for the composer that you play , the composers that you play more frequently , and you can feel easier to feel in it , and feel easier to feel in it .
i &apos;ve become older again , the seasons change , my pulse is going to slow down in the morning as the morning , in a auditorium that the sound comes back as home .
after the logic , these self-deception , these self-deception , the willingness , a different reality , as the ones we actually know in the unconscious , is to spread it out .
the beautiful thing is that , in this island , you basically , in this island , it &apos;s all that we &apos;re going to be able to do all the things that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our share of renewables .
i still have to mention that nathaniel is a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric power and with the power , and it was exploding , a trauma that has been tracking his whole life .
and in exactly that way , nathaniel was nathaniel , when we started with our first study in walt disney disney hall , he had this crazy thing to do with his eyes and seemed completely lost .
and as through a miracle , he took his violin , and he started playing a few snippets , and he asked me to play her , and then she then decided to play .
when the first one is done , when he &apos;s walking like this , it &apos;s all very clear , because the increase , the energy density is so different as we know it .
it is , you know , it &apos;s very short in front of a nanotube , and just funded the learning process . i think we should try more things that have the potential to be a lot more expensive .
it requires us all of our senses to the task , and that we think we &apos;re using our thinking , how our emotions and our minds are , in the challenge of us .
but if you put the shape in which you give the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and those blue color color and color , it turns out , it &apos;s actually measurable .
so , i &apos;m suggesting , if you look very quickly , look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive thing in the back here .
that &apos;s true for terms of thinking about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re so mess like everyone else .
imagine your next holiday , you know , at the end of the day , all of your pictures are wiped out of your face , and you get a drug drug , so you &apos;re going to remember nothing .
everybody who &apos;s not different from those terms of reasoning is the study of happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers about well-being that have been fooled for the research of happiness for a long time .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference , we say , in climate .
and they would be so eager to be the most amazing , because games are so fascinating , and we &apos;re surrounded with a lot of plastic mechanisms , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are being able to use human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
and to be honest , the only real and sustained disability with which i had to be apart , is that the world is constantly meant to describe me with these definitions .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all of his forces and possibilities , we can recognize in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to do , another disease .
and perhaps this change could happen because i &apos;ve been so many people who have opened the doors , instead of watching people who were holding me or i wanted to get a clue .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i like to design rockets rockets to send the genetic energy in the next stage to the next stage .
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can allow the change to prevent disease , can also enable us to embrace the disease , the better memory .
they &apos;re nothing different than something you &apos;re going to get in the morning and give them extra strength and increase their pace , and that will help them keep their balance .
so , if i look at this room in this room and see people who have either come to be successful , or they &apos;re on their way , i want to offer this to you .
this is to say , it could be something , in average , which is the female brains of male different things that make us more likely to be a social social relationships , and more and more expensive to make the difference .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we design .
and this is -- and that &apos;s the whole circle -- that this whole circle -- that this april , in the middle of los angeles , will give you an exhibition show in the inner los angeles .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had anything to do with it , but i just got a little bit out of it , and with amazing people around , so that we could put something on the legs .
so when i started talking with companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
and if you play with your particles , you &apos;ll find all kinds of weird things -- like you fly directly through walls , or you can be at the same time at two different places .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of plural , who meant that we need to make this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way that it &apos;s going to be our country .
in fact , you know , the first time you ever saw more information , the first time you had more information than the second time , but i would think it &apos;s a real thing that you would think about the second time .
and we ask our colleagues all around the world , from other universities , to help us to behave like how to behave in the world of the world .
but more importantly , this app is that it represents a new generation that &apos;s the problem of government -- not as the problem of an institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things in common , you have to build the only systems .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically taking notes of me , in the hope of creating a similar kind of puzzled idea in your head that has a certain idea with my original idea .
i live a living from building computers and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i &apos;m using to build computers , not to use computers , without the process of computing .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to provide the great challenges of our planet .
and at the end of the day , i took my stuff down , broke the hospital , and went to drive the car with the car , when i did something i didn &apos;t do .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen after woman after woman , but another three words to me and that three words that i have , most of the time , who i know .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , that a child would have lost the wrong leg in my hospital , you would think i would have trouble looking into the eyes .
a couple of weeks ago , we brought to risd and we gave them some designers that didn &apos;t have any technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power . &quot;
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything , and they were killing the world &apos;s cards , and they killed the five spelling of the devil .
you know , we really -- we &apos;ve got a lot of goals like substitute of all the fiscal industry . right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? the world &apos;s climate change .
my father , for example , was chemists and i can &apos;t remember the situation in his 40 years as a chemist that he asked if he was afraid to be chemists .
it was as if the time came up and the dancers come out of a kind of a nanotube . he did nothing different than he ever had before -- 1,000 nights before , but all laid together .
if a performer in spain was doing something a magical thing , it &apos;s done a magical thing : aid designer , sports engineers , a lot of time , a great , exciting , exciting thing , because it &apos;s a glimpse of god .
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic state of the arctic , which had been the size for nearly three million years of the lower states in order to reduce 40 percent .
and if these tools are going to become physical and consciousness for their movements , to recognize each other and see the edges of our lives with them , we can begin to start with the study of new and more entertaining .
and so i &apos;m going to put it in front of german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equivalent to me by translation of translation .
now , the notes of everything else is a record of the message of the mystery of composers , but only a framework , i can now turn this framework to get it back with meaning and meaning .
in both of it , it &apos;s not too late to see if you can &apos;t do it , or learn to learn how to do these little muscles that have the vocal chords , right .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s also the talk , the talk , is that you can be a collective , and you can use the solar power , and you have a little bit together .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a kind of farm , it &apos;s enormous , because the water that comes out of this farm comes out of the river .
businesses that are not in the worlds for themselves , businesses , instead of rebuilding food , rather than not just a lot of people , people who are not just making a lot of money , farmers who are not just doing it .
so , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we bring these tools to every single website like this .
and we actually made a reality about six months later , in fact , in which i was going to be a russian in a russian of the north atlantic , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic through an hour .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
the fact is that their communities are not going to grow over many years . it &apos;s going to rain too much or too little . the things are going to change how their fragile environment cannot sustain .
the industrial revolution , the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a serious case in the central and so , we have refrigerators , air conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
to really understand that , what is deep in the ground to build almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel , that uses , and then the process starts , and then the process starts to go down ?
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a speeding reactor and some countries have built this , so everyone who has done a fast reactor , for our first .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow , and you put it carefully on the top , and you get a step back , and you put a step back .
but then , almost always , almost always happens , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to be a &quot; 24-hour &quot; is because the weight of the microphone is that the whole thing is going to bend , and the whole thing .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we think we &apos;re seeing , what we &apos;re seeing .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the human self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the modest self , which decides how happy people are .
so , the problem of the world of warcraft like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at anytime on the edge of a mosh victory , that we &apos;d rather spend our time in these clouds .
first of all , for kids in the united states , they &apos;re more likely to do the exact amount of time that they spend in school , from the fifth grade , from the fifth grade high school .
we &apos;re putting games in order to avoid anything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , which is not worthy of the real life , and we &apos;re going to get what we need .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in games ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve done my work in the last few years at the institute for the future .
the other volunteers who got a little bit of me in front of me -- let &apos;s call him lex luther , the first one and was asked to go to the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
years ago , when i went to graduate school , one of my graduate students asked me about feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , doing it -- a really strange question .
no longer a building that would open up to leave you , but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump down now without getting wet .
and i was confused because i thought that the whole concept of advertising was to present your product as so many people as you can see how many people can see .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; are you welcome to transparency , &quot; which was told you about my good friends , who paid $ unclear in ebay .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , well , my first question is , are you ready to hear about listening to this thing ?
i &apos;m not really interested in this , i was not really interested in being a friend , i should look at this great video , about a guy who in new york against bicycles .
you can see who we were and how life formed us , we can now see that the men who might have come to our lives , we would have come to the protocols .
now , we &apos;ve got to say , &quot; aaaaaah , &quot; which people bring in the grid forever forever , for the theft , for the theft , for the theft of creativity , rather than that you forces them to give the sacrifice .
this is a state in which the heart is failing , instead of breaking the entire blood to pumps , a part of the blood pressure in the lung , and they catch these slowly , and so on .
in fact , in fact , it was so much to me that i asked the nurse who was taking care of woman &apos;s printer , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if you go home ? &quot;
you might think that the problem was human beings , who certainly lived in the developing societies , killing animals , and they were very aware of some generations , what they had done .
so when we &apos;re thinking about things like this , the obvious answer would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a good citizen .
they threw copious pictures from the air , which we would grade as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people had never seen anything in their life .
now , the fascinating thing is that the most exciting thing that &apos;s in the food industry is , you know , the kind of thing that is needed to be necessary to be able to get around the ground . so ask yourself yourself .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that the performance of a system like this can be , is the number number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
do i get you right ? your software allows you to have a certain time , within the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world &apos;s most connected ?
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about it , it &apos;s easy to think about alternative properties that they make , that make them feel less comfortable with the alternatives they &apos;ve chosen .

i don &apos;t have to worry about these things emotionally , because in the same way it &apos;s going to be the corner of the corner , there &apos;s always a different kind of crazy , evocative outfit that just waited to me when i love a little bit in the heart and looking for it .
the second thing that i learned about this day -- and that was , when we were doing the george washington bridge , it &apos;s pretty much about 50 -- i thought , man , there is one thing i really really appreciate .
see , when i was a kid , and my father got me lying -- and there he sits , and he looks at me -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three versions of every story .
we put the lights off , put it in a vacuum , and we put it all out of the air , and it &apos;s going down to almost now , in the elevator , was the piece of metal , and it was the piece of metal .
it was worth me for all this year in the clean room , because , you check that , the most prolific between one atom and this piece of metal is about just as much as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
it should be our goal that when families think about this , where they want to live and work , they give you the opportunity to pick up between at least one hand full of different cities who are all in competition .
so i had another deal with facts , which is a graph like this , which includes this , which has tried to show that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , an appliance , new york , and not only do it , but something you need to be grateful about , maybe a gift of the trickster .
some bacteria found out how to stay away from penicillin and have written this information with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria which are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
now this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years were needed , because that information had had to be learned by the individuals who died because of this kind of mineral , there were still not .
one day i was sitting there listening to these women , and after a few hours turned to me , women were told to me , &quot; well , i &apos;m saying , &quot; well , &quot; tell me , what &apos;s the same initiative for the same right .
it &apos;s a system where there is two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do it . those who don &apos;t do . those who make sleep with bad results and with good results .
you can think of this cultural shift as a function of the world &apos;s time , and it can be used as the total total of all thoughts and dreams , myths ideas , inspiration and intuitions that have been produced by human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
a continent will always leave , because the guess was that there was no religious belief in sub-saharan africa , and , of course , there was one and voodoo is just the left of these very deep religious thoughts , which as the tragic diaspora of the south union .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which is how i hope you &apos;re in unison with other things that you &apos;ve already heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to create some connections , if you didn &apos;t notice that .
and i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices up , because things are supposed to be more intuitive , always more natural , more natural , more natural , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually for us , of course , what &apos;s wrong or intuitively .
and that was an early school , because of course , you started working the living language in the form of the script , which means what you &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s called life , and i &apos;m going to put it in stone and i put it together .
and when , of course , a little bit intuitive , and as a creator , i &apos;m going to take it as a creator , and the things that make it so much that they &apos;re going to be able to make a solar ball , so that &apos;s why they &apos;re fun and easy to use .
but i have to understand in the core , in the mind , when information is going to be information , when information is becoming information , when information comes from information and information , so i know how to make things more intuitive or more of course .
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of them are the majority . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss .
and , again , if i take a step back and look at all the time , i can start to rethink my course , maybe after i &apos;m looking , and here , i &apos;m looking for &quot; dig , &quot; for a live , here , after bing labs .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could just make it simple , but in big and large and whole , it &apos;s something we need to give , and we &apos;ll need to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the self itself , and you can think of the self as a result of self as a function of self , which is sort of the most appropriate self that doesn &apos;t need to do that .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of the world all over the world , if we take the barriers of the next century , the face of those who are facing all odds in the edge of a epic victory .
and because i had been born without a parent , and my feet were looking for them , and i had just a few toes on that and a few toes on the other foot , he had to put the most bad news in the face of the face .
most women , like i -- i believe being a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real life , but i think i probably have the typical -- most of the women like me in fact .
we &apos;ve been working on the top of our time , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- in the metropolitan theater in new york and the scales in milan -- we took his movements in 3d to use it as a momentum to use .
and i met these people from computer research , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to project light on every surface , and then draw with a plastic that &apos;s just the negative area .
in order to make these theories , we call it a reminder that it &apos;s definitely in terms of food , it has to be about a high quality and very likely to be in iran because most of these infections have been reported .
the main reason for this is that we might be able to enjoy this huge asteroid shelves of all of these giant shelves , mustard , spin and spin , but we can &apos;t actually draw the comparison and the peril and then actually choose something from the amazing supply .
and we know that it &apos;s just not a sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything is going to be so different that a simple division of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
&quot; when we were in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to do all kinds of things , but what we needed most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness , sometimes to be desperate , and witness . &quot;
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can &apos;t get the quiet voice who told me what &apos;s really happening , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
the u.s. revolution that brought us to agriculture , and at this moment , the cult of the empire , the poetry of the fittest , was replaced by the prose of the priesthood and hierarchy hierarchy , specialization and surplus -- just 10,000 years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom the embodiment of the modern modern artist , who was trying to master these kinds of creative impulses that lived in it .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been studying a couple of years old , and that &apos;s what i did , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do it , and i wanted to do it in particular , which i learned in education in theory .
and then there &apos;s things that are totally available in the everyday life , which most people don &apos;t realize , for example , for instance , for example , who allow us to wash 40 degrees of laundry , are also genetically modified enzymes .
because i think that the interactive media in us , cognitive models rewards , is a paradigm that has been in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we &apos;ve just been able to build through interactive media .
and so i get from the city a very different view , a very different impression , which is i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
we see this here when i do things , and then i can make it confusing , like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make it intuitive , by showing things .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back of the back doesn &apos;t go and says , now , look at all the time , and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to see what you want to see .
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the world , it &apos;s going to be able to go back , then you can have a baby in israel , and in tunisia , and in tunisia , trees can plant trees .
and perhaps a little bit of a reference on what might happen in a few decades , if you &apos;ve got to have something to explore or do something else , in all sorts of different forms of information that i think i can think of as being myself .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we would probably be able to make a lot of use and less use , but in average , this number will increase every year , and all of a sudden more than double , the number of services will be put in the one hand .
if we &apos;re in a corporate culture , i believe that many of us are turning into our best version , at any time and immediately helpful to solving the problem , trying to solve the problem as long as it is to try again .
what we also found is that the goal of the attack was actually to make it slow , and to make it happen -- obviously in the attempt to try and make sure that they &apos;re not going to be able to get there .
now , what this thing is doing is that the forces of the forces of sensors -- so for example , for example , for example , for example , and it &apos;s available -- and it &apos;s available to the code that &apos;s still in the attack with the wrong powers .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and food , just to discover and separated , immediately , and characterized by visibility and access to information , especially , which is most likely to be the biggest problem .
rs : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- how people around you , the friends , the family , the family , the way you live your life , work and so .
tan le , the blind american prize , was now tan le , was now anthony le and social activist , who was invited to talk about places that they had never heard of , and in homes that they had never imagined .
and they &apos;re also going to be able to see where i &apos;m going to see , so that it can see where my business is , and it &apos;s not just at the moment that i need to support , or with a glimpse , but also with a glimpse of the past .
one of the things that i learned through the x prize is that little teams that are motivated by passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that could only create big businesses and governments in the past .
look at this amazing demonstrations : learning in a nanotube , the hot coal , the frozen coal without combustion , an amazing illustration of the spirit of the mind that this is where it &apos;s in a state of extreme arousal .
how can these people come out of an elite species of 80,000 species of plants that are not related to these two types of bacteria , that if they combine combined , in this way , they can create a kind of a variety of version that &apos;s bigger than the sum of its parts ?
but it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago , when i first told a teenager that i wanted to be a writer , i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of industrial response .
i &apos;m a creator of a house , which is , of course , i &apos;m also , of course , with the issue of curiosity and how change the curiosity again , and why we might have a curiosity and we need to redefine it , and so on .
that means that you &apos;ve found a shared language , you could communicate with one another in the same cave , and it &apos;s moved into the same cave , or in other areas , cities , or villages , like that .
in front of the background , i just started looking at what &apos;s meant , what is it for us , what is , of course , what are we going to do , which is , what is the difference ?
that you don &apos;t just have a word of word for word for the word in a different language , but also the deeper sense of words and understanding the deeper meaning of words so that it makes you a good translation , everybody has a good translation of it .
since then , i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers , architects , and architects and architects , and there &apos;s something that &apos;s deep impressions in the nature of collaboration and i want to share some of them with you .
but one thing is going to happen . they &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier , because if they &apos;re thinking about it , they &apos;re going to be reminded about how horrible the weather was in ohio , and they feel that they &apos;ve made the right decision .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s , when i started with elementary school , and started making my sense of self outside my family form , and form to form the other children around me .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be so flexible , like other kids , or that you would never have an independent life , and you &apos;ve just been lying on me . &quot;
you &apos;ve got a lot of time , you know , you &apos;ve got a lot of the grade students with a &quot; sufficient grade , &quot; the grade , &quot; very good , &quot; they told you they were very clever , and they were actually written by these three months .
on the bottom of the ocean , the bacteria are there , and that is , in fact , the hot steam , and that &apos;s what the steam steam is , if fish would be there , they would have eaten some vacuum , they would have a habitable environment for themselves .
but when i was working with him , and he asked him why he did these surgeries -- it was very high surgeries -- his response was that in his country , these kids would be treated very bad , and so he had to do it .
we took a team of treatment , and we &apos;ve put them together , put them on a glass , and now we &apos;ve got a device that &apos;s freely available -- you can build it yourself , we can make the code free to download the software .
as i said , i went into some pretty terrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing to me , to do anything so difficult and so dangerous with these guys in a room .
i also believe there are theories that start to understand how it started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a little bit of a story about what &apos;s going on in this time , that there &apos;s little oil caps that contain different types of chemicals .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i spend several thousand dollars -- gps , sorry , and a photograph , libraries of books and music , technology to medical medical imaging -- are now going to be cheaper and cheaper in your mobile phone .
and they &apos;re going to be able to be a healthy healthier system , and they &apos;re getting better trained by being educated , and so they &apos;re going to be able to use 3d printers , and so much more productive computing , and so much more productive than ever before .
whenever we think of conventional and landscape , we &apos;re either going to be able to fly down and the old craftsmanship of the fancy wild up , which is in his place , which is a kind of thought , or on the other hand , and it says , these people are connected to nature than we are .
we believe that , in fact , we believe that there &apos;s no compelling , but we believe that storytelling is not compelling , but we think that storytelling can change the world and we &apos;re probably probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million bucks every month .
but that &apos;s so my prototype , but pretty wild , it looked like this , so on a branch , the thing that was on this , electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure to be too high .
and these sound and the rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region , and of course , it also enables you to get these songs and put it in a way , and turn it back to the left and back to the left .
and then the next one , the next , which is now with the studio neural model , or mental model , has been working on the software , which is , you &apos;d have a notion of something that metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
and then , if i take a step into this natural user that natural user interface , where i &apos;m a voice , by language , by touch , by gesture , by gesture , by gesture and chips , things have to steer , i &apos;m still faster and more duck .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of being driven by nature , it &apos;s going to be a lot of the bigger piles , you also have the feeling that you have to have a sense of a free will .
and the wind and the sun and the sun and the load , and came to the conclusion , a very exciting outcome that you take over the conventional system , which takes a middle of about 50 cents a megabyte of about 50 cents per megabyte .
they add up the carbon footprint , which leads to the grid , which has a few very negative consequences . effects on weather , and perhaps worse , the consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to that rapid change and all kinds of systems .
what you have to do there seems to be simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to do all this , you have to catch all the co2 that &apos;s coming out of the mediterranean , catching under pressure and hope and hope there .
it also has three big problems . the cost of the cost , especially in northern africa , is high . the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i could choose that , or i could choose this wish , which is , you know , this wish i &apos;m going to take .
because at the moment , where i &apos;m going to give you my hand , so you can see it from the back of the back , the finger here , my shattered , just from there , where he was so abundant .
and it turns out , under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a incomes in 600,000 dollars a year .
so perhaps this technological change is clear , because ever , there &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every human being in society can do something very , very powerful and very powerful , and the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i figured out something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in the world of living organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going into both two baby friends .
i think they were so versatile and strong , and so radically radical , in what they did , i &apos;m looking at all the few years in the world , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten .
evelyn , because you think that he &apos;s got male -- although i don &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s going to be a male -- because you think he &apos;s a male , he can now be moved , what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is making progress in the field of anatomy , that we have a point where we have to admit that democracy is based on anatomy ?
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i talked to a couple of years ago , who had a few warning twins with each other , to separate them , to be part of a name .
what we have learned from our studies is that women , in average , average -- not each , but average -- tend to tend to tend complex social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable within the group of vulnerable .
now i &apos;m going to give you a study that i &apos;m talking to you about , i &apos;m talking to the ted community , and i was doing some sort of a research company , and i &apos;d done the decisions that we &apos;re going to be doing for the recovery of almost one million americans in the entire united states .
i &apos;ve been telling you about four techniques that govern the problem of development -- just -- are just going to get the surplus of the alternatives ; they &apos;re going to do it ; put it on -- we can do better with more categories , less options .
in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code is made from normal letters , which we use to talk about , and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna , and i have written it 10 ^ 22 times .
and finally , i think , though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so inspired , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not in the things we develop , not in our intellect and minds .
about one hour after she got home , after i sent her home , she collapsed , and the family called 911 , and he was calling 911 . he took her back to the top of the road with a blood pressure , which is dangerous .
but if you buy a new computer company in 2011 today from the top of 2011 , and print a page , it &apos;s a bright yellow page on every page , in a pattern that makes the page clear on you and your printer .
understand that it &apos;s not only that people need to eat food , when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go to the travel , it means making decisions so hard to miss their employer .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end up less miserable with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
but , as we think , the only way to do biology doesn &apos;t have a huge impact in the cost of the cost of food or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as we see co2 , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to work on cells .
and with this premise with this premise with this premise , he tried to try for example brian , for example , and he was trying to put an example , and then , you know , he took a test , and then , yes , and then it &apos;s got bacteria , and then it &apos;s got bacteria , it &apos;s going to have bacteria .
i was trying to do this in my lab , and i &apos;m trying to push a little bit of scale on ebay , and then i would have bought a little bit of it on ebay , and a little bit of an analysis analysis , trying to test a test , so that &apos;s how so many of the times you have to do , then home .
and yeah , so you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively diverse , so there &apos;s a place of people who are doing this on their own home , so far larger organizations that are going to do more and more expensive , as well .
so now , if i do this to the scene of the scene at the scene , then you go there , there &apos;s any kind of money , and then they do this kind of technique , and then they can say , &quot; okay , this hair belongs to this man , this way . &quot;
with the total transparency , which is the new thinking , what is the next thing to slam up to the old thinking , don &apos;t tell you that in the middle line , there is no more or no beef , or any of the other phenomena , i want to just do that .
he was talking to a very , very famously , and he &apos;s talking about yo-yo masters and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers would never do it in the baseball world series of the first violin of benjamin &apos;s fourth symphony .
and that curiosity was also showing that i was always when i was not in school through the forests of forests , followed and &quot; specimens , frogs and snakes and beetles and beetles and beetles , &quot; led to the microscope .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; aaaaaah , &quot; why they thought molecules were going to a certain kind of a random way around the area of nature .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work and sometimes , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid to do a real end , and it holds millions of people from flourishing .
if i would take this post seriously , i would be born into a world that someone like me would see as a person who can &apos;t have a person in any way , but today , i &apos;m going to have to be celebrated .
i may be more likely to be clear that we don &apos;t necessarily need to get through the fact that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get to hug them to give them a hug , and they &apos;re going to be able to take a hug , and perhaps even dancing with it .
if you allow somebody to activate your own inner forces -- the human mind is so versatile -- if you can do that , and for somebody in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
now i &apos;ve got to say , when i was a computer scientist , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex , sex for sex -- it seemed pretty sound at the time , but with every year , it has come to my higher knowledge .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute the right in terms of people , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden things that are probably going to make benefits more than some people i know .
or you could close the building and get the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , this days , if you put the roof out , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
so , what &apos;s happening in &quot; the &quot; the death chain , &quot; is that all the way down to the bottom , from the top to the end , from the very beginning to the end , is to the end of the room -- from the ministry that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand , this is the brand .
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator alone , i &apos;ll do all kinds of weird things , but then other people will go up and do all these things , because i don &apos;t really want to do it , because i don &apos;t really want to do it , or frankly .
so the question i &apos;ve all got for you here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things we have to do together , all together , are we going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
now , the problem of the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the difficult condition of native americans , and look at them as a function of animals , but they &apos;re kind of limited to the past as the real world , which is our world .
this very strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called a biography called a biography called naif , love , love -- that decided to get different books from some of the previous books in the world , and a big one of the other things that i &apos;ve had in the world is that it was made in the world .
interestingly , interesting historical reasoning , when they came up with this practice , they took this practice , and the pronunciation changed over the centuries of the centuries of trade , more enterprising , more cosmopolitan , more cosmopolitan , more cosmopolitan , who you &apos;re still talking about , and you &apos;re hearing .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that this is what you &apos;re seeing in the future that you &apos;re actually going to be in the future , but in fact , the future is exactly right in us , with our roots .
and then , if i don &apos;t think about that , there &apos;s no more likely to see , there &apos;s a unit , which is a circle , which is a circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , another one .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to the other , we start to get a lot of things , and can see some things that otherwise would be hidden ?
so , there &apos;s a great amount of energy there . there are challenges in terms of transmission . if we say that the energy source is out of the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you have to deal with the risk of where it comes from where it comes from .
now we know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not a line between the male and female , or between male and females , and the male and the female and the female and the female .
so we started with some volunteers who were helped us a little bit more than a year ago , in seattle , to highlight things that they were doing -- different types of things , like you can see -- things that would throw them away anyway .
and the idea is , again , imagine what we &apos;re doing again to do the people who are doing something , and change the environment -- almost something like we call it , how do we do it , but with a cloud .
this made me a different human being than my friends under the u.s. coast , who believe that these forests of the dotcom of the aphid and the curved spirit , and the observable spirits , are the spirit of the world , minds that live in the world .
there &apos;s 175 , in my supermarket , when you don &apos;t have the 10 different extra extra extra bits of pollen , and you could buy 12 of them that you could buy to make a large number of pounds , which is unlikely in the store for you .
but the process and the heavy motivator that surrounds him was no more than he took the genius out of where he was doing nothing as trouble and he left where he came from . he realized that it had to be a failed thing .
so if you look at google , for example , then this is a concept of what the virtual world is doing with the real world , which means our transportation system to experience the virtual as something normal , it &apos;s going to come back .
because we have these self-deception , this sense of being great , to be the top of the individuals , not from the highest creatures , from such a kind of material , such as an organism , like an organism , which is still for us .
later on the day , i went on this site with miguel , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be a place that seems to be , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success on their predators on their predators , but a farm that is literally a single , and not only for those fish , but to me .
and that was the most salient form of one that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i put in a corner , i knew what was going to happen in the core of the vehicle , because i ran over the movie for months when we were doing the film .
i took them , and i gave them access to the world down to the bottom of the world , and i took them to see that they were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the extreme situations , and i took them to take samples and test samples and test instruments .
you &apos;re doing it about the task of the challenge , and the ocean is the most powerful environment , which is , you know , you &apos;re doing it because you &apos;re doing it because of a small group of people forming a team .
and then there &apos;s a more powerful self , and that &apos;s the model itself , which is that we get away , and the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that makes the doctor feel , &quot; how did you feel in the last time ? &quot;
and one day he looked at me at one of my practice -- these practices were just tiring , and then he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll be one of these traffic supplies .
and dr. augustine kept telling me , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if they don &apos;t say anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , they can do a lot of money when you get kids . &quot;
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m in italian , and everybody in italy grows with this picture in the room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is something that happened in the last few decades .
i got to the place , and i &apos;m standing towards his brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this way : tony &apos;s going to talk to him , we &apos;ll get a device , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can do it again .
the leaders of the government in honduras would depend on the help of steel , and they could benefit from their citizens that they &apos;re building on the laws of the law for this charter and to address that everyone can really take trust that the charter is really recorded .
in the process that we did , there was a rise of participation around 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise to four percent of the amount that they were willing to pay for to pay .
this was a woman park , and he came back back to christmas school , where two of her oldest friends were watching these older women who had developed women who had developed the most complex -- an incredible anesthesia -- and virginia , a white , whose husband , the husband &apos;s husband .
the old black man stood up . he looked at the chief , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to tell this boy , you don &apos;t lose the goal of your eyes . don &apos;t give it up . &quot;
and in this song , we &apos;re going to acquire the opportunity to be what we are : people with full awareness who are aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to thrive in space , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans of some kind , and they bought them , and they were sick , and they were very poor , they were incredibly fond , and if they carried them long enough , they started , &quot; ok . &quot;
after all , a consequence of a bad trip of a bad retreat , when there &apos;s only one way to buy that if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you ask yourself why , who is responsible , the answer is responsible . what could you do ?
so she goes to the house , and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem through her and she reaches a pen just as it goes through her stone and then -- she said -- she was like this with her other hand and put it on .
he was running at high speed when he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody , which is a lot of the way that inspiration often is , for him , for him , and he &apos;s a lovely thing , and he wants it . he &apos;s a gorgeous thing , but he can &apos;t grab it .
it really works , that &apos;s going to be done in the academic community , and then we thought , &quot; well , you know , we &apos;re going to get rid of this , you might have a webcam , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens . you have a microscope , you know , you know , a microscope .
and in front of the background , i started to interface in the field of natural contact design design , so the next generation of human computers in the relationship of the human computer in the relationship of the human computer is how our tools or how the computer is changing from the computer to the digital assistant .
and you can see , you know , there &apos;s a seven senses that most people think we &apos;ve only got to be five , now , in the near future , there &apos;s certainly the next , eighth sense , and as an extension of our self .
i &apos;m probably , you know , the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m likely to be the generation that &apos;s made for this bad picture , because i &apos;ve already begun to study airplanes in college , in engineering , in engineering , and i think , i think , i think , kit .
now , what you could do with a patient , and we &apos;ve done clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s done , you could actually extend the most basic of the patient a way to just shake it down without too much .
i read this list of a friend , and i had to laugh , and i had to laugh , so ridiculous , but i just got to &quot; quit &quot; and i didn &apos;t have to go back , and i had to go back and start to read , and let me go and start to pick up with the emotional shock .
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it says that he took the hammer and he threw him on moses -- in fact , you can see a little bit of a spot -- and said , &quot; do you want to see a little bit of a spot ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
they knew that every year about 75,000 hours of their land left their country in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in plural .
it looks like it &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really looks for is someone who &apos;s going to be doing it , because he &apos;s white , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the age of a foot .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking do , is , we think , in a certain sense , we &apos;re going to do a little bit of the machine and the machine and the machine makes a difference that our capabilities , better and faster than we could possibly do .
and we went back to eight generations and we found two cases of natural death , and when we went back to the people with ambiguous something , they gave them that one of the people that was so old , he died because of his age , and we killed him with the mad .
she ran as the devil was tracking her house while she was tracking this poem , and it was not that she had to get fast enough to a piece of paper and a pencil , so she could capture it when she passes through her .
these are the ones that have more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and in collaboration with scientists doing so , with these technologies , and asking questions about these technologies , and the creative thing is , there &apos;s all sorts of things .
the first project we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we were sort of aware of ourselves , is to get rid of it , and we &apos;re now going to be here as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re now going to know the people who are going to talk to be very well about and so on .
imagination is more powerful , and i want to close with this sentence , and i want to close with this phrase , a and a half of the evidence , also designers have to think differently , to get to new solutions , and in this sense thank you very much for your attention and please .
that &apos;s really beautiful , if you do that , so agriculture does , it generates biogas , on a hectare of country with five thousand people in favelas , and it can build a farmer , and they &apos;re going to be able to grow a farmer and the vegetables and the vegetables and the fish .
this is what they &apos;ve got to do , between the unconscious and the conscious , which immediately jump out without doing something about it , and the things that they know that they can look like a lot better for them and others .
these may be a moderate contribution , and if you do better than i expect , that would be great , but my arrival here is that we need to work on all these five , and we can &apos;t give them a lot of them because they &apos;re very scary , because they &apos;re very scary .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never have been sensible , whether it &apos;s going to work , but since then , modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes .
now , for a while , i &apos;ve been interested in the first time . it may seem strange that a magician cares about it , because they &apos;re looking like me as a &quot; deception , &quot; which is going to be a little bit of a time when someone believes it .
so where the founding fathers were very reflective to figure out how individuals could be protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we were more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re going to have more to a concept of , not just how to protect them , but how we care about each other .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the greatest part of my career that seems like terrible situations , and this is all for trying to study social networking that they are convincing , and hopefully , and hopefully a way to understand what makes them fun and accessible to the audience .
and the idea of the president of presidents was that the host of the host that i thought i was thinking about as a way of getting the foreign investors and building this city might be relevant for all of the parties for many years under fear and mistrust .
but i remember the lights of the wing coast of the coast coast , and the young man , who died and died , the end of the journey , was too much for him , and on the taste of the first run that gave me one of the men on the platform .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design , taking back a year and work in an environment that is so much everything that is actually what they really hate , we &apos;ve done them in government .
the next couple of weeks i did , and i learned for the first time myself , the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you can feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; the world isn &apos;t a better place , if we &apos;re all talking to a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let me say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a vegetarian . &quot;
there are a couple of people who are doing this on 60 percent -- 80 percent of them , but they &apos;re going to be able to get a lot of the footprint , and one of the things that &apos;s going to make the co2 is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the most powerful .
i don &apos;t know if this is smart , if you get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in search of it , whether you have to do that , if you want to get the stuff faster , or this innovation takes longer than we expect .
and if you &apos;ve done a few minutes , you know , that &apos;s what you have to do is make the patient a bad turn on the patient , and you have done it that you have a lot better on the patient &apos;s experience , because now you have a better story about your experience .
i had to do some kind of work , and i had a lot of the effort to do that with this heavy , elastic adhesive -- in different colors -- you know , in different colors -- and i &apos;ve hated these pieces of wood , and i hated these pieces more hate than anything . i hated them . i hated them .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and particularly how we look forward to the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a number of options .
so the ted talks in very simple shape that a charter city is a place , which is the beginning of the land in the beginning of land , which is the laws that include the laws , and the people who are capable of deciding , either under these rules or not .
now , in the world of the world , i think one of the best examples that came out of the market has been about how to make the best choice , was something that david was offered very strong , it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard .
i wanted to go back to a routine and the comfort of life of an unknown life -- a grandmother , and two daughters , and two daughters who are so identical for each other of their day as they told each other about their day , and they &apos;re still in the same bed .
at this point , the patients come in , they can &apos;t only be the control of the day , captain on their own ship , but can also help us in health care of the challenges that we are facing , and the world &apos;s health care , double demand , and so on .
&quot; shhh , &quot; something that my friends call autodesk , &quot; the sensors and networks , robots , robots , 3d printers that allow us to democratize the personal production of our planet , synthetic biology , electrical and artificial intelligence . &quot;
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature , which was literally , in the walls of a nanotube -- about the kind of thing that it was like , it &apos;s sort of like bermuda , the design and the artist &apos;s work , and the result of the work of work is invisible .
and then the renaissance came and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- about all the gods and the mysteries , and there &apos;s no more room for mystical creatures who take orders from the divine people .
and the problem that is not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a product of what kind of dumb things , a question , a question , and how you can do better .
and then it came out of the founder of the founder of the founders , and he said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got to meet ourselves now , even real , and then have two things , and then put two things , and in san francisco , in san francisco , and shortly after that , in san francisco .
this is , if you focus a laser beam , in one in a room , you can catch little particles in the air , or in the fluid , and then you move into that focus , so that &apos;s what you &apos;ve captured , like this , you know , that sort of thing like this .
i was afraid not to speak , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could destroy him in one of his states , and i could destroy him his relationship to the violin , when i started talking about scale and other exciting forms of happiness .
i had written this piece &quot; avatar &quot; that was going to push the measure of visual effects and financial effects in all over new heights , with severe human beings , expressive characters that had been produced by using aid , and the world should be all the power .
in some of the expeditions , i saw the creatures in southern africa , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that haven &apos;t seen even before , and for the science , when we saw them , even never found words .
and if i think about this , i think about a vacation that we did in antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best holiday i had ever had , and i think quite often in relation to how often i think of others .
so what you got was this : you name your name here : my tedtalk , you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and you end up with the ears after the ears , especially if i lost your company for your involvement .
so by making color , contrast and contrast to the edges of the single images , the single images of the world , the number two , the things that we see , the color of the colors and gadgets , we &apos;re going to see the boundaries between the various images , and let &apos;s take a picture of a single picture , which is basically hundreds of levels .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best of the world &apos;s rights , it wasn &apos;t a kind of internet , it wasn &apos;t a street , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working as an assistant at the end of the world at night and at night at night .
they &apos;ve put these pictures together together with the real space that they &apos;ve been doing in the same way that these shots were made in the canadian state , and they &apos;re all in the canadian state , and they &apos;re looking at elements , and they &apos;ve got them all in relation to each other .
but if we look at these metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our own . trust me , this is simple , but if we look at all these genes we can eliminate one of the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
but we don &apos;t even get rid of it , if we hear somebody hear something like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of term for a long time . somehow we have the notion of how we &apos;re going , and the collective accepted that creativity and suffering , of course , always leads to the bottom .
in other words , she didn &apos;t paint fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and she would roll the poem through her and she would miss it . she said , &quot; searching for another poet . &quot;
now , not exactly what i hope i would have , but i went -- the stairs up , the hallway , along the hallway , the &quot; real &quot; on this time , which was actually so done with the &quot; the bedroom of a pair of shoes . &quot;
another one , a couple of years ago , i received the phone call , who was born as a young boy who was born as young men , who had had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had just found that he had portuguese and a uterus .
so we have such a situation where , the further our science progresses , we need to be able to say that those categories that we &apos;ve held for solid rates , which made a very simple amount of view to create permanent water , a lot of little little little little bits than we assumed .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in iran , where a man who feels sexually to other men is being punished with death , because he &apos;s ready to put in the way he can stay alive .
we &apos;ve got this gene , we have these things that we want to do in life and i thought about all the people that i wanted to make a hand , and didn &apos;t do all the fences that i wanted to fix and i wanted to do .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to be willing to be too simple , and you &apos;re going to be able to get rid of the irrelevant possibilities , you &apos;re going to have the cost of sales , and there &apos;s going to be a cost of innovation , and there &apos;s an improvement in the cost of innovation .
it &apos;s the friday friday , friday , friday legs , hanging down at friday friday on friday feet to the front door to the front , and friday , friday , friday , friday down , and i didn &apos;t think that we would have that conversation , without talking about this video , i hope .
how often have we chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we will expect , and we expect the government to reflect our values , and then we don &apos;t have a lot of changes ?
the reason is , if i would draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the year , so the time of a way , and this is a random measure of technology that i want to share with a graph , then the graph is silly .
and where you &apos;re looking away from that , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , that we &apos;re at all the planet , you can see , for example , there &apos;s a program , for example , for example , for example , to 20 40 pounds here , right ?
and our goal was , we wanted to go to 70 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s still this remaining , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , that will be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work , it &apos;s going to work very , very expensive .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t know that there are only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way that he processed information doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three , but she looks as a group .
well , i like to be a little extreme , you know , how little bit of appetite do i have in memories of memories , but even if you do more of it , you have a real question . why do you give memories so much weight to the weight that we give ?
in our desire to protect people who are at heart and they tell you the cold , hard truth about their medical justice , or even putting a forecast to the quality of life that they were expecting to do , we don &apos;t really have to be disabled that they &apos;re actually being disabled .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the power that you can bring in the new elements of your new elements -- like the testicles -- and also , as a matter of the game , the way it &apos;s going to be enormous .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually to use a new kind of network , which was used around the world -- that &apos;s a -- -- and the anonymous and the absence of information from this network to be able to understand how the city works .
but there &apos;s only one company , an agency ready to help us -- and it &apos;s also because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard challenges for years -- i realized that i had to do it , and i had to go to the companies to go to the companies .
so in a study , we &apos;ve done a study that i &apos;ve done with a lot of guinea , and collusion , and we &apos;ve done a study with the people who worked with the people who have been working on food -- employees that have been working for all of them -- and these people were all in a meeting where they had signed their participation for their possessions .
these older people are now coming to me and say , &quot; mr , overreaction , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking to people , you tell people that you should stop saying that we should have to do it for the first time in our nation &apos;s history . &quot;
in my about 20 years of medical medicine and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study on medical mistakes and false treatments to make all of me possible for one of my first articles , which i wrote for the toronto , &quot; white , &quot; way , to learn .
i think a significant -- not the only one , but a significant thing to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced , because their standards are so high , and then , if they have to explain their standards , they think it would be their fault .
a group of ankara , which i &apos;ve met before a while ago , which is a little , which would like to give the public to the public , which is what they &apos;re learning in school , and they &apos;ve been trying to explain what they were doing .
many of you are going to know the story , because of some of the things that became a book , which was a book that was repeated by robert lois &apos;s , as steve lopez and jamie lopez , as nathaniel fry , who was done in the morning , and his very promising career through his favorite career .
bill gates : to perform the simulation on a supercomputer , getting all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we just need some 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor , it &apos;s just to make sure that it &apos;s sensible , it &apos;s just in the most abstract million .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a college class , who was a story of mine .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the margins of the tree of life , all existing species in the tops of these branches have been successful in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; it has survived its environment , fitness .
so my colleague at mit , i &apos;d tell you , is a lot more about the experience and the many other wonderful things that you can do with you , but i want to talk to you about the second part of the environment , which is the first part of our environment .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid the things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re going to be afraid of , these elements , and they &apos;re actually going to turn them into something positive , and they actually turn them into a positive move .
but it &apos;s going to come from 17 years old , which were ready to get out of those control who wanted to do with someone who wanted to make deals with someone who was doing so relevant and error , and the things that we do , and then finally , were telling us to tell stories that we don &apos;t usually have been able to support .
and this is a reconstruction of the cathedral dame dame , which is just in the computer with pictures of flickr . just give it notre dame in flickr , and you &apos;ll be able to get pictures of men in t-shirts , and so on that , every one of the orange cone is a picture that was discovered as to this model .
you know ? i think to allow one person to think that he thinks he or she is like the vessel , like the pelvis and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknown , infinite mystery , is a little bit of responsibility to make her mind , human psyche .
the people at the back or the one that you see later on video will say , &quot; well , that looks very impressive , but if it were real , it would be -- look , here &apos;s a hole , and there if it &apos;s really real , it would bleed .
this is probably something that seems to be a little bit of a second , so i &apos;ll do it so that it can work : if we look like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
it would be great if we &apos;re going to make this paradigm against a different one of the possibilities or the strength , even a little bit more dangerous to put it in a little bit more dangerous , so we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their whole special skills into society .
but we wanted to go much further , and we wanted to build a whole universal chromosome , and it has more than 10,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we &apos;re building it in tapes from the size of the virus to understand what the individual components of a living cell are .
and if you &apos;re in part of the software that we saw , it &apos;s going to be what you see , and then you can understand why 99 percent of our world &apos;s software is very intuitive or not usable in a lot of other areas , or in fact , even though it &apos;s a lot more intuitive than classical software .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and they &apos;re going to do it with nasa , and they &apos;re doing right now , and they &apos;re going to go to russia , go through the mission of the mission , and then take a handle on the international and take place .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the nobel prize prize for francis arnold , and he had two scientists , two scientists who are working on the other possible process of evolution that encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster , which is to work , which is a stand-up arnold called direct evolution .
if i show you 600 magazines , and you put them in 10 categories , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 papers , and those in 20 categories , you think that i gave you more choices and a better job than i gave you the 600 , if i gave you 600 .
and that &apos;s when you all have your feelings about politics and the snake , and all the other things that we really upset about is government , in the words , in the words , in the words of tim o &apos;clock , which we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
if you &apos;ve ever had the chance to work in your evolutionary call , like our fellow scott , as a part of the program -- in fact , they do all of this -- you &apos;re going to see that people who are in the government are calling the government for many different problems including , including , for many different problems .
and from a conversation today , with dean kamen , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me the permission -- he gave me the permission -- he gave me -- the size of the size , and a lot of you may have heard about it .
no biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are short before extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet , that -- that &apos;s the most difficult thing to do in the area of the biological diversity .
and that was really , really , very high , and then you come in again , and you just showed up a picture , where i was asked to go to 10 years old , and a thousand years ago , which was , of course , in the collective , of course , whether that &apos;s really the great thing to do .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve figured this out -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds for about three seconds . what does it mean , you know , there is about 600 million of them in a lifetime .
these people have come up online , but they &apos;ve made it illegal by using horses to steal money from our online bank , while we &apos;re doing our online banking business , and we &apos;re doing our online online , and we &apos;re going to put our online computers online as we go through a infected computer .
so , you know , one of the great things about travel , and one of the joy of research is to live with people who remember the old days , and they still feel in the wind days , and they still touch on the wind days , and they touch stones in the bitter sheets of plants .
if one of the people who said , &quot; no , &quot; no , &quot; that was a completely valid thing . i have a couple of years old , i &apos;ve got a lot of time on it , whether i &apos;m going to do a really good job on my child , because all the colleagues of my father , you know , you have the money on your child .
this equation has four factors , a little bit of reverberation . they have this thing on the left -- co2 , which you want to take away from zero , and that will depend on the number of people who are using the average energy for every service , the average energy for every service of service and co2 .
we &apos;re at the verge of amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think we need to go back hundreds , 300 years before the enlightenment , to find a time where we have been fighting progress , in which we &apos;ve got more and more important than now .
a few years ago , the scientist was given to the scientist for his research , and he was given an adult health company , which was an adult , and through the manipulation of only four genes , the cell manipulation of the cell being able to go back to a glowing stem cell -- one cell is potentially able to go back to a credible stem cell .
i went back to a young colleague with 6,000 miles of macedon in northern kenya , and when i went to siberia , i saw the face of the statistics of the statistics of those which were being murdered in the cultural revolution , which had been murdered in the cultural revolution , which had been assassinated in the cultural revolution . 1.2 million people who have been assassinated in the cultural revolution .
what i first show you , as quickly as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we call microsoft as a part of a year ago , giving it to us , and it &apos;s an environment where you can either get locally , or it &apos;s an environment where you can either deal with a local amount of visual data .
bruce brown , a famous experiment at the university conference , is so far to say that mass mass mass , it means the book , and the image , so not television , the internet , and so on as a mass of mass media , and so on , what we call mass mass media today is that these mass mass networks of our memories .
and if i do this now , for example , in which i link as any sort of time , i think , as a kind of experience , as a choice , as a choice in the case , it &apos;s going to come up to me , and i can see it in the details , and yes , i can throw it somewhere , and i &apos;m going to buy it .
the first , if you &apos;re a child big , as a baby , is that you take care of what you &apos;ve got , right ? and depending on whether your parents allowed you to play more or less in your parents , the more you have , of course , to get your curiosity .
in the early 1930s , i got a really amazing task when my professor asked me to go to haiti and see if i was interested in going to haiti and the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength and the secret that was used to make a sense of power .
now , we haven &apos;t been able to put it on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting things that we call for the nuclear name . there &apos;s a big interest and the people of the company in russia , india , china -- i was here and i talked about the energy energy , and i &apos;ve been talking about the energy .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions because if you have a patient who , you know , , you know , we had two different surgeons , and they decide what to vote with , which is the one who &apos;s going to pick up the memory that &apos;s going to be less bad and less bad .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret of your best friend , even though that one on a pile of your hands and then you get caught and you get the best friend , you know , and the best friend that leads to you , and you &apos;re going to be able to make a mistake like that .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years or technical innovation , but rather than an era where we &apos;re present , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth on earth is active or passive . so the problem isn &apos;t the change .
and they &apos;ve got two builders out there , and they said , &quot; well , we &apos;re going to make this easier and cheaper , and then we have the open source of open source , &quot; free hardware , &quot; free hardware , which is the most cheapest , and they &apos;re now the cheapest line of these devices .
&quot; disabled , &quot; which is &quot; surrender , helpless , useless , useless , heated , mutilated , mutilated , closed , beaten , closed , closed , furious , furious , angry , furious , furious , furious , furious , furious , furious , furious , furious , furious , furious , furious , furious , furious , furious , furious .
if i was in a room full of colleagues , and asked her immediate support , and started telling you what i just told you , i won &apos;t get the end of the second story before it really would give you a joke , and you would have a joke to the rest of it .
and this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the street in the middle of the street lab , and i fell in love with one of those modules of doubt that we all fall when we were working on something and it &apos;s not working . you start to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster . it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
we also have one of the same big sizes in the same size , as he says , in the hall , in fact , to actually get the whole dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall , it looks like this , there &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s the great battery that we &apos;re going to simulate .
if i want to illustrate a thing today , it &apos;s that the sum of the data that we consume is larger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about it , i think that they &apos;re going to be thinking about how we can use information that they can &apos;t be able to be visible .
and if you were to choose a holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species , and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think about time , you might get a different answer .
this was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that the richest five girls in the clinic in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my everyday experience with new eyes .
this sentence of dealing with disagreement is the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge to master , without being able to be connected by that , as if my life could be so successful , because i could have been able to deal with my disability with a prosthetic with a prosthetic toy , or how to deal with my disability .
we &apos;ve cleaned the chromosome of a laser . roughly , these are the two of those as far as human beings and mice , and we gave a bunch of them to pick this chromosome . we could pick it up with enzymes to destroy all the proteins . and it was very amazing that we put it in a cell -- and it was very amazing .
as i was looking for models in the past year to do this , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might be able to do better , to see if we could help them deal with the emotional risks with creativity .
here at the bottom of the picture , you &apos;re looking at the lab , in southern afghanistan , so you know , this is a kind of a garage garage that has all sorts of other kinds of wood , which is the university of the college , a group in paris , which is a group of things that are built in paris , and it &apos;s a pretty interesting thing to do with it , so i want to do a project for a while .
i suggest to you all , reading the book , or look at the film , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness between these two men that were born between these two men , but the way that the music made this link , and how they ended up with the instrument , when this twist was allowed to get the growth system .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and then the co2 &apos;s co2 , then the skeptics says , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t matter that it &apos;s not a co2 , i wish it , but i &apos;ll probably accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
i had recently met such an encounter as i met the extraordinary american poet , which is now over 90 , but it was over the whole life poet , and she told me that she was working on the fields of the landscape , and she told me that she was growing up and could hear how a poem was growing up on her landscape .
the human ability to adapt , and this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me how to deal with odds and i &apos;m going to give you a little bit : this sentence has never occurred to me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with the questions of people , and i think i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable about it .
in other studies , sugar sugar has shown a measurable effect in some studies , which is just because the person thinks what happens to her , is a change , or a kind of -- in a sense , if the patient &apos;s only found enough about it , it &apos;s a measurable impact in the body that &apos;s called an instrument .
for example , women who were using the right place , the concept of the founding fathers , that says , is that there &apos;s a lot more important than the rise of difference , and said , &quot; we have a uterus , &quot; we have a uterus , &quot; and we should have a uterus , &quot; and &quot; we should have a uterus , &quot; etc . &quot;
now , now , if you want to win , if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something that &apos;s going to be present in real time , some thousand sensors that are going to pass information from the car , and then apply things to this car , and then apply things to that car , and then apply things to this car .
really , some happy people , and companies , and business companies , they got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let me do that again -- to buy the talk that was not going to be a title , which was actually a lot of the time .
now we &apos;re all using , or many of us , gmail or one of your competitors , but these services are particularly common in south states , like iran , where they &apos;re going to use these more trust , and they know that they &apos;re more trust than they can &apos;t do any more confidence than they do in their conversation .
and the young girls are separated at age three and four years from their families , and in a more primitive world of darkness , in southern afghanistan , for 18 years , and two periods of the glacier for 18 years . two periods of each time , in fact , i think they &apos;re going to mimic the nine months of pregnancy .
margaret shannon , who said the great anthropologist before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that while we &apos;re moving towards a thread , we &apos;re going to be able to reduce the entire range of human imagination , we would not only see the entire diversity of human imagination in a single way , but that we would have a day to wake up .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a burden of responsibility is a burden of responsibility for making decisions of someone who knows of decisions from someone who &apos;s a little bit -- ninety of the doctor .
and that would be your answer to the most violent argument that , if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 , all the other goals that suffer , all the other goals are suffering from malaria and so on , which is a dumb waste of resources that we can do .
in my show , &quot; white ball , black art , &quot; i &apos;ve got the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . &quot;
i even have with my professor , richard evan , who is the man who had the philips mushrooms with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico , and i said , &quot; i argued that you didn &apos;t have any more than a hallucination to experience a hallucination , because in the moment you feel the impact , you don &apos;t have to experience a hallucination .
i &apos;d like to show you one of the original developments of noah , and that &apos;s from a very early prototype of gibraltar at the first prototype that we &apos;ve ever been working in the summer to show you what i think is really the punch line that we have on the website . and that &apos;s not necessarily obvious if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
and now just wait to biology , and i want to take this metaphor that will stop from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a brain change , because it &apos;s a more abstract code , it &apos;s a more abstract code , which is that it &apos;s just like computers , because it &apos;s matter , therefore it &apos;s not just like computers , it &apos;s not just like computers .
and so there &apos;s different , but the nice thing about it is that a million times a million times as much energy is as much energy , say , we say , if you can deal with the problems and that , if you can deal with the issues , the impact and the cost of the land , the impact of the land , and the other things , almost in a single sample .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all got the kinds of batteries that are produced , looking for cars , computer phones , cell phones , for everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with the amount of electronic energy , which is the world that we can produce less than 10 minutes .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re taking people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted of death , 11 times higher , if the victim is white , when it &apos;s black , when the sun is going to be black , as if it &apos;s black , in the same states .
and so the idea is , now , when you have all kinds of problems to invest in something that you only have later -- and that &apos;s why the investment is not so clear . in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world , and there are people in the rich world , and there are people in the rich world .
so i went home , and i went to dinner with my wife and i told her , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology , if there &apos;s this technology , that you can use your eyes to control things , then you should be able to make a sense that you can control a laser , and then you should be able to do that again . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t have a lot of space to do that in the field of food , or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have a mystery of the earth , but they have a mystery of the earth that doesn &apos;t occur to the idea of being aware , but in a far more unequal sense , the idea of the earth .
it means that a small child from the andean , which is growing up in the sense that the mountain is going to be a heat , which will determine your destiny , or your destiny , will be a very different person , and a different relationship to that resource , and a different relationship in montana , which is a small one of a mountain .
now , let &apos;s take a step back in the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of creatures , perhaps three to four billion years of life , and then the human species , perhaps a hundred or a billion years ago , and then the human species , which is , in the last couple of years .
if somebody had done the trouble and all of these saints , and he tells you who they &apos;re all , then , my photo , it will be with all this data , and i can use it as a starting point to get the photos of other people &apos;s lives and use it as a starting point to get the photos of other people &apos;s lives and use it as a starting point in this room .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who doesn &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good moment , you take your personal breath , you take your personal attention -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn hussein &apos;s book , and maybe you can take a sense of sally .
so that the system has evolved to create , which is what makes it easier for us to find people who are inevitable , and it also enables to create more smart , supportive spaces , where anyone who is watching health care should actually actually be able to address things that are potential , in fact , , in fact , which is a potential thing to do , which is a potential thing to do .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the snoring , and all the way around , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human performance , and the difficulty , the human performance , if you &apos;re working on the ocean , you can &apos;t explain it to someone else , and you know , you can &apos;t tell anyone .
i was really quite extraordinary that he took away from my entire childhood , no matter whether i had won in the second grade in the second grade , whether i was in the second grade in the second grade , whether i was going to get rid of my scholarship , and he was using these clips to teach his students to teach their students to teach their students , to teach them to teach their students , to teach their students .
usually my role is to explain the people how wonderful the new technologies are , what are the emergence , and i thought , because i &apos;m here under friends here , i &apos;d like to tell you what i really think is , and i &apos;m going to try and understand what i really think is going to be going on with these incredible periods of time .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- with my favorite and my colleagues , i started to wonder , &quot; what if we were going to use computers , i started to wonder : what if we could do it with both two hands , which is like a digital performance , which is like , &quot; if you could do both of the hands , and you could build it like that ? &quot;
it &apos;s not a matter of whether it &apos;s in the woods in the forests of borneo , or the billboards in haiti , or the warriors in the most sacred of the world , or the warrior in the middle of the world , in which i &apos;ve been traveling to the desert , or a month in the middle of the sahara , which is the colleague that i traveled to a month in the desert .
now , one of the things that we have , of course , have been the problem of a growing company , and we then have a small group , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to start small and go back and go back to the next topic of the future , and i think it &apos;s a little bit crazy to say that people say , &quot; well , it &apos;s going to be a little bit crazy . &quot;
i &apos;m going to leave my favorite words , and i &apos;m going to give you a english scientist , and i think , the way that i suspect when he was defending the most popular experiments of his health community , his apprentice was michael strangelove , he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , &quot; which is , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind . &quot;
at this point of view , what &apos;s said , &quot; what happens if we &apos;re going to be able to make a difference in our country , what if we &apos;re just going to a message of the american embassy , a part of the canadian state , and if people want to go to the middle of the board , they can do everything , and they can go to the bottom of these messages , which is what they usually do for canada or america .
and we &apos;re going to do a series of trips in the world where we take our audience to places like such cultural wonders , that they &apos;re careful by the opening , and hopefully , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to take one out of the central revelation of anthropology , that the wisdom of all humans can find that we can find a really multicultural in a multicultural plural world .
so , i &apos;d like to wrap up my talk , and that &apos;s in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve made out of the board , and the skills that we &apos;ve made out of the field , and that we &apos;ve made a little bit of a little bit of a sudden , is that it can actually be activated in the future , and in fact , to our roots .
i want to end with a poem , which was written by a persian poet called the 14th poet in the 14th century , and i told my friend , called &quot; the god who knows only four words . &quot; and the poem is called &quot; the god who knows only four words , &quot; he says , &quot; come , dance with me , &quot; always says , dance with me .
and if you have people who are the solid belief that they have a soul , or you can also say that they have been brought out of the soul to live , then they think that they &apos;ve become a mental framework of their lives , and they &apos;re kind of a intellectual framework , which is kind of a intellectual framework , which is a little bit more intellectual .
what &apos;s fascinating is so fascinating , it &apos;s not just the most powerful potential of this web , but it &apos;s going to be built . it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources , on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden tube , which is a series of thousands and a half of the fish , which is , in fact , it &apos;s just like a blue orange smoke , and it &apos;s going to be like a black smoke .
one of them is allowed to have the great choice of different differences , when they buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is , you know , it &apos;s perfect ? it &apos;s just imagine that you could have a different choice , which is that you have a choice , which is a good decision , and that &apos;s what happens is that you have a good decision .
at the end of this amazing overview , you &apos;ll eventually be looking outside , and for the first time in your life , at age 18 , you see a sunrise , and in this particular moment of consciousness of the first light of light , when the sun &apos;s sun begins , all of a sudden , it &apos;s all about what you &apos;ve learned . it &apos;s really , you know , what i &apos;ve been telling you about .
how can i talk about the relationship in the 10 minutes of women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of that connectedness in the life of a four-year-old girl , when she was about 30 years ago with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother in a little bit of a little bit of a boat , and she &apos;s a little bit of a person who &apos;s been married in san francisco , and she &apos;s been talking to her in a small boat today ?
from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the most cosmopolitan , of titan , of titan , from titan and artificial health cells for aging body that allow people to actually use their ability to use their own own their own lives , not to speak about their own nature , to be able to make their own own their own lives .
just knowing that , in fact , there &apos;s still more and beyond the milky way that the myths of the inuit of the inuit matter , or that in the himalayas of the inuit , the buddhist ceremony is still the breath of the breath , which is the idea that the world we live in , in fact , is the idea that the world we live in , it &apos;s the idea that the world we live in , although it &apos;s a kind of a sense of reality of a group of certain possibilities .
it &apos;s invented , but we &apos;ve got enough attention , so it &apos;s going to be realistic for you , and it really makes you live without any oil , so , if you &apos;re in a game , you know , if you &apos;re going to get your life , you know how much oil is going to be , you know , how much oil is going to be , whether you &apos;re going to be able to do it , how much oil is going to be , how do you do it ?
and wherever you &apos;re in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not the doom . these are dynamic living peoples that are being replaced by basic forces , by the way , in which you can see , in fact , the most powerful footprint in the country , which is , in fact , to a new generation of greenhouse angeles , which is , in the world , of course , of course , which is , in fact , , of course , of course , to be able to
