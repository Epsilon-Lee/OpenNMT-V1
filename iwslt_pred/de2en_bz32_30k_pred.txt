not entmutigt .
this is a fingerprint .
the sun goes on .
the orange tractor .
yes , hello .
fantastic , right ?
that &apos;s wrong .
long , yeah .
yeah , milliseconds .
the only chance .
nullemissionen , yes ?
don &apos;t find it .
that &apos;s efficient .
all the umweltdiskussion .
not toxic inside .
but it goes .
yeah , sort of .
music as a language .
lento , slowly .
i wonder .
that &apos;s the singing .
they need time .
a schüler student .
this is fast .
here it is .
this is vorbildlich .
not very sustainable .
they schlemmen . &quot;
that was fascinating .
an enormous challenge .
we need energiewunder .
thank you . thank you !
bg : thank you .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s terrible .
shame . shameful .
it works like this .
very different term .
we know that .
dk : 60,000 .
and he says ...
a few less .
that &apos;s us .
it has sensors .
i swear to it .
does that sound good ?
after a week .
you can go inside .
i did awe awe .
thank you .
that was incredible .
no hospital either .
thank you .
... not yet .
that &apos;s scary .
it &apos;s generisch .
yeah . okay .
a whole lot .
jk : both .
i can help .
i was amazed .
ban is blank .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m tom .
thank you .
i created one .
are they all ?
we &apos;re losing them .
oh my god !
ohhhhh , wowwww !
there were remixe .
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
we were poor .
where ?
centers were built .
my gut gut again .
that &apos;s not ...
bewerte again .
we raise off .
i vertrete kids .
or bombs .
it would be intolerable .
it would be gewissenlos .
we love innovation .
we love entertainment .
oh my god .
schlafmangel is ubiquitous .
there are online-kriminelle .
they sell zertifikate .
they durchbohrten each other .
thank you very much .
these days are over .
what do you want to do ?
they actually hurt .
everyone needs a goldfischglas .
this was the result .
i find them abscheulich .
can we change it ?
just do your job .
this is the speicherbecken .
this was about christmas .
this is the last one .
good work ! yes !
so let &apos;s see .
yes , good afternoon .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
yeah , that &apos;s going .
what are media today ?
they have similar principles .
why does that happen at all ?
does anybody see some particular ?
a dalmatiner , right .
i see the dalmatiner .
that &apos;s our present .
what takes fünfundzwanzig milliseconds ?
give pee a chance .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
let me tell you .
no tree is kohlenstoffneutral .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we can do it differently .
and it has to go back .
wonderful , right ?
but the wrong things .
so what do you say ?
each waste is nährstoff .
so not like detox .
we can do that .
does it make you curious ?
the work of interpreten .
so compare .
all of that interest me .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
you see it immediately .
i can say anything .
there &apos;s nothing at all .
yes , good afternoon .
that &apos;s the name today .
we were 20 people .
it &apos;s already going on .
that &apos;s the system .
what a fish .
i wanted to supported them .
let &apos;s call him .
that &apos;s me even .
what did they do ?
they fluteten the channels .
the farm is incredible .
there &apos;s no food .
can i be honest ?
and i was an artist .
it was really profound .
who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
next , nuklearenergie .
that &apos;s great .
that &apos;s a wish .
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
who is the most successful ?
what was the result ?
there are also weltrekorde .
and i understand that .
people were playing crazy .
we &apos;re talking about zwiespältig .
the data came in .
but you know what ?
not very often .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
dark urine . dark .
there was no cantaloupe-melonen .
why do we do that ?
it &apos;s not a country .
because you know what ?
yeah , i know .
how do we know that ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
thank you danny kahneman .
so they do that .
it may sound nasty .
players don &apos;t sit around .
glückselige productivity . fantastic !
that &apos;s exciting .
transparency is emerging .
there is no normal normal .
oh , so that .
that &apos;s very good .
some more .
what about longevity ?
maybe 10 times .
he opens the door .
why no longer lives ?
these are going to be unwiderstehlich .
so it &apos;s true .
they &apos;re all important .
be a mentor .
who are these related ?
play is not silly .
so where do we go ?
ooh , thank you .
thank you very much .
first extension , second .
italy wins . yeah .
here &apos;s the video .
his name is tempt .
i was told him .
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and they did that .
that sounds frightening .
you could see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
almost identical structure .
the power plant can explode .
i have a question .
that would have been okay .
that &apos;s very risky .
this is the kurzfassung .
überlegene technology .
it keeps you fresh .
hmmm , my brand ?
my name is amit .
i see this pluszeichen .
polite have all applaudiert .
first , narrow .
but you know what ?
how are they interested .
let me wrap up .
so how does that work ?
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy kimmel .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i lived in parallelwelten .
i don &apos;t know .
is it even photography ?
what creates the illusion ?
oh . a moment .
okay . thank you .
so they meet al .
and that &apos;s important .
they use their hands .
there are two options .
i &apos;m going in here .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
silence is ohrenbetäubend .
i find this fascinating .
i find this fascinating .
we &apos;re constantly chasing .
i thought about it .
i don &apos;t think so .
that was big .
here &apos;s an example .
let &apos;s talk about wasser-kriege .
what do these people need ?
hey , why not ?
it doesn &apos;t work somehow .
it &apos;s a thousand , very good .
i learned everything .
but i kept working .
the nurse said sachlich .
so she was back .
they gave her blutdruckerhöher .
their family came together .
and she did .
and i kept working .
actually , he collected fish .
it was a zackenbarsch .
what &apos;s happening here ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing today .
we have three hauptgruppen .
these people deserve money .
this is alfred gonzalez .
diginotar is a zertifizierungsstelle .
privacy has to be there .
the rocks are farbcodiert .
i will stop that .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
the living give the minds .
now , what does that mean ?
so what does that mean ?
156 countries send our fernsehkanal .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
the official department of what ?
these are all einnehmende questions .
here &apos;s another example .
thirdly , the expectations of expectations .
do you want jeans with holes ?
but i felt worse .
initially , we only signed .
why should we do that ?
seriously -- ending up .
and i always had .
why not think about that ?
this is a jährlicher tauwasserfluss .
these rivers take very rapid .
the wassermengen have expanded .
let &apos;s get that quiet .
they really loved it .
this is an interactive trickfilmanwendung .
... his own story invent .
so now what &apos;s hacking ?
this is what you see down there .
how do we actually work people ?
that &apos;s what it sounds like in principle .
they didn &apos;t have books .
let &apos;s make a little zwischenbilanz .
from the vogt-zeitalter to the maschinenzeitalter .
we &apos;re not producing ourselves .
it won &apos;t do it .
pattern recognition is going to work .
now you see the dalmatiner .
a very interesting phenomenon .
you have to understand that too .
this is the so-called osit-modell .
and it depends on phosphorus .
they can store no energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
the phosphor-problem is much more critical .
it &apos;s in leukemia .
but this is not protection .
luckily , right ?
so we &apos;re too many .
but where are we useful ?
we can return our nutrients .
in china it was different .
the byproduct is clean water .
but we need that in total .
or take a lippenstift .
there &apos;s any footprint there .
we say in germany .
so there are two cycles .
all of that is kompostierbar .
it must be the altersunterschied .
he was over 60 .
his personal impressionen . .
most of you know this .
this is like sprechenlernen .
because you can train that .
have you been jealous ?
it &apos;s against justice .
it will always be more similar .
they &apos;re interested in the feuermachen .
he &apos;s signed up .
i can say anything .
these things are logical .
it &apos;s not that soul .
this is such a naturding .
this is the naturdinge record .
it &apos;s engaging with serenity .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
it &apos;s just not technology .
what would everything be done ?
and here &apos;s the plot .
and then they set up .
i only loved two .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
2.5 to one , great .
let &apos;s also call it don .
it &apos;s kind of verkuppelt us .
the chef had verkocht him .
he showed up the algae .
but what are your fish eating ?
how is the futterverwertung ? &quot;
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat phytoplankton .
i &apos;m almost never cooking with it .
i don &apos;t like that question .
you want to feed the world ?
now i see greg lemond .
so they saw something magical .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what lessons do we learn ?
it &apos;s gone up now .
first we have the population .
today , billions of people live .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
and then these vent vents .
and there &apos;s the lagerungsproblem .
it really solves the treibstoffproblem .
what should our record look like ?
this has the biggest impact .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we have to spread the message .
this is just a versicherungsmethode .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
it was a huge success .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and then realized it .
so i tried something interesting .
so what did you think happened ?
there &apos;s a schritt-für-schritt-anleitung there .
and why is that ?
diphterie , röteln , kinderlähmung ...
the result of this was devastating .
because anybody here has measles ?
so paul is a terrorist .
the data is all the time .
i agree with you .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i push my sleeve back .
but the key thing is , ...
yes , here it is .
there &apos;s a lot of glücks-coaching .
but it didn &apos;t .
he had the experience .
there &apos;s an old study .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
they have so much uncertainty .
so correlation is small .
that &apos;s not true for emotion .
and there are tons of staff .
so the first aufrechte primate .
and finally , epic meaning .
they create a epic story .
edward castronova is a volkswissenschaftler .
that sounds crazy , right ?
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 since 1994 .
the game is from 2007 .
i &apos;m going to end .
i want to ask you something .
i think it &apos;s not .
how about fitness ?
is it just einbildung ?
or is it possible ?
some came and went .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
it cost 2,7 billion dollars .
these changes are in the coming .
who doesn &apos;t want to be healthier kids ?
play is not just kinderspiele .
and that &apos;s called androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so what happened for years ?
and women do succeed .
but i buy nothing new .
is it going to have my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
good afternoon , all together .
here you see the city .
you see the timeline at the top .
they saw the big deal .
and then everybody went down .
it really enjoyed him .
you can have this cloud .
here you see roberto dancing .
here you see it .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
no insurance can behave .
it turns off the engines .
i had a good life .
it feels great .
you see the water coming .
but it was very sad .
and then something funny happened .
and that worked very well .
and it was even better .
but it gets worse .
is that your mind ?
i &apos;m a redundante person .
that was more to confirm .
take the camera .
what else is it even risky ?
we &apos;re a smaller token .
that &apos;s a great question .
and this is a millionen-konzern .
thank you for your patience .
yes . all right .
the spikes are very good .
what other brands are doing ?
that &apos;s a great question .
and it took 18 months .
i grew up in india .
so you go to googleartproject.com. .
just further . lots of fun .
these are all metadata .
you see something funny here .
apparently it was quite popular .
they come from artists .
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
again , he showed him javier .
the two people called me .
it mühelos a thousand square kilometers .
one place is south korea .
here is the olive storm .
here &apos;s her marmeladen gait .
the third technology : kategorisierung .
here are two different types of beans .
okay , a few more .
what am i looking at ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
and then it became international .
something versteifte in me .
loans and sponsors were been looked for .
so i followed my feeling .
just a journey there .
is it about light ?
here &apos;s another example .
but it requires a lot of planning .
but there is something else .
maybe even in our phones .
i work in the solartechnologie-branche .
it &apos;s expanding fast .
so scott gets this anfruf .
they joined these two people .
did you see these guys ?
something very strange happens here .
they look like this .
it &apos;s about it .
it has billions of them .
maybe a few mutations .
but they do the job .
so it &apos;s going to create a rückkopplung .
that made me really sad .
but what do we do with that ?
and this opens up a map .
these are the apsaras .
my cousins were running around everywhere .
i will never forget it .
i will never forget that .
my brother looks at me .
i was devastated .
i &apos;ll tell you something .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
we lost the contact .
the only country in the world .
i vertrete people in todeszellen .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
we love technology and creativity .
she &apos;s going to touch her deeply .
we want to abolish . &quot;
sometimes i follow too much .
so i went to the court .
once the judge saw me .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
they are an inspirational personality .
crisis . death . disaster .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
and many people forget this .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
we &apos;re thinking today about energieknappheit .
and there &apos;s good news .
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
and so it was .
i felt really good .
actually , i made two mistakes .
my second mistake was worse .
the notfallpersonal moved all the strands .
and then it happened again .
he always showed here .
and fortunately , he died .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
and is the crux .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
my name is brian bieber .
it &apos;s about veränderbare normwerte .
it was my first sonnenbrand .
formaldehyde , they &apos;re five centimeters .
they were genetically erdrückt .
there were still fish .
this is a dead turtle .
we started a living .
she wasn &apos;t ertrunken yet .
it &apos;s not going to document .
you always lose animals .
what do you do with zertifikaten ?
the firmenhauptquartier is right here .
they tap their internet connection .
privacy is not the debate .
so littlebits open source is open .
they are the heimatländer of somebody .
our magazines are read by millions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
a has these benefits and risks .
it &apos;s all easy to have today .
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
second , what economists call oppertunitätskosten .
they could have done better .
so let me remind you .
economists call this a pareto-verbesserungs application .
we have unique elements here .
sunlight and carbon are a method .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
it includes huge amounts of control in the control room .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
okay , that &apos;s really what &apos;s going on .
so , you know , you know .
so the question is : how ?
what is this thing ?
go and quäle leonard cohen .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
the dauereis is labeled with red .
this is a completely unhaltbares entwicklungsmuster .
this picture reminded me of something .
here he is turning the sun .
now i add a bass .
it was quite a pretty schickes project .
or they didn &apos;t have any fotolitografie .
no , no , maximum .
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s going on ?
this is a game for outside .
for example , this perception in context .
does anybody know what that is ?
so it &apos;s the n circle .
this is also a paradigm shift .
and then i can transmit this whole thing .
you can &apos;t have teeth else .
we depend on two countries .
and we take it all .
it &apos;s about the urine .
there &apos;s no überbevölkerungsproblem on trees .
and we &apos;re too many .
imagine mozart efficient .
that &apos;s the minimum one .
not all of them should be kompostierbar .
for example , the sneaker , right ?
technical cycles are exactly the same .
when it &apos;s currently the garbage .
i started an institute of this .
so basically a translation of translation .
the beweggründe , it &apos;s to write .
how and what did he feel ?
have a nice example of this .
this is a getragenes part of it .
because for me it means memory .
now , the instruments have fortentwickelt .
it wasn &apos;t actually invented .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
and how did that feel ?
i &apos;ll take something through my head .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
picasso says , just wait .
my wife told me .
here you have this little mechanism .
we can &apos;t just do that .
and then he can just davonlaufen .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
and i particularly contacted him here .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
it &apos;s going to go automatically .
again , you have it again .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
thank you for your attention .
they always say , why ?
it can &apos;t be a problem .
natürlicht is then bietet .
so , smart-grid , a riesenthema everywhere .
and of course , that &apos;s really träge .
this is going to happen in the next april .
for nathaniel , music means seelische health .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i said , &quot; hühnchen-pellets ? &quot;
i entliebte from this fish .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and green was a catastrophe .
they literally umgelegt the lever .
schlemmen ? i was completely confused .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
he shook his head , no .
this is a ökologisches network .
a billion people are starving today .
the creativity had to sort of out .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
they live with chemosynthese .
so that was really changed the dynamic .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
in fact , the fortschrittsgesellschaft is based on energiefortschritten .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so this is a tough problem .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
this is going to be a key element .
other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
they &apos;re not investing in time .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
my grandparents rejected these numbers on 70.
we &apos;ve got it bezwungen . jump .
so that &apos;s the good news .
the same thing , only bigger .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
and that made me so mess .
don &apos;t give you anything .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
nobody has said that before .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
this is ideology , not science .
we refuse to gentechnisch food .
and why ? gentechnisch changed food .
it &apos;s about a potato .
because we don &apos;t want to have genes ?
also the dosage plays a role .
and the shape plays a role .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
what does a story of ?
they didn &apos;t change the history .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
it was almost beyond imagination .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
but it &apos;s definitely not optimalsituation .
so this crazy story could be true .
so , we can .
i read you the post .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
widrigkeiten are just our lives .
honestly -- who is normal ?
i wanted to be normal at the time .
the students are divided by grades .
would you like more attractive and more confident ?
which one would you like most ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
we have a kind of equilibrium .
now , how could that happen ?
and that was 19 years ago .
well , i was the next one .
the hauptmann winkte me .
but the game is a formwandler game .
they &apos;re both überlebensfähig , both zünden .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tiger .
monday : color is a little powerful .
tuesday : adapt is totally überbewertet .
thursday : confidence is the key .
they become computers in the free .
this is the morning .
the game begins -- silence .
the data was not available before .
the whole building was water .
but reality is always unpredictable .
they can play with different kinds .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
and this video is in real time .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
we won a few prizes .
this is a picture of a circle .
she did three years .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
so we start with a windows-dropper .
that &apos;s a piece of play , right ?
it &apos;s completely focused on a specific destination .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
this is just the only arbeitstitel .
we need to think about what brands .
that would have been no problem at all .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
a whole bowl of cool food .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
these things have a positivere effect .
how would you describe your brand ?
i really like beautiful clothes .
lawyer : i &apos;m a anwaltsmarke .
tell me about this world .
what else have you gone through ?
eeeeee ! no , thank you !
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
the movie was not going to be implanted .
you go around and rejoice .
you want to orient in the museum ?
now this is one of the images .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you now .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say that .
they can be logical and intuitively .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is a picture of the object .
and that &apos;s what we did .
so we measured his movement .
we are in an area .
this picture is from this place .
they even get funding with one .
think about your own decisions .
now we saw the opposite effect .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
here &apos;s a description of the road .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
this is a profoundly unnützes kategorisierungsschema .
who do you really want to inform ?
we need to increase complexity slowly .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
well , then we want .
he had uploaded a lot of naturvideos .
what is happening that day ?
that &apos;s it , very simple .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
who could have all this voraussehen ?
the story is not over .
i never met him personally .
no , no way .
her mother moved them alone .
the defeat would have been too simple .
who would ever wish ?
i believed everyone could .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , a realistic plane .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
the unterwasser-teil comes from a quarry .
how can we help you ? &quot;
and every morning i get it .
and we &apos;ve created a ipad-app .
it will take attention to you .
this is a humble little app .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
they didn &apos;t give up government .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call-center .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
how do i get them removed ? &quot;
good night , sweet beutelratte . &quot;
so the occupythesec-bewegung did it .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
but that &apos;s not that fast .
we don &apos;t go on .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
and these are the neural structures .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
all of these generations require few milliseconds .
it &apos;s verworrene and strange programs .
so gewissermassen überflügelt gives us the technology .
we &apos;re in the middle of this übergangpunkt .
now we do this with airplanes .
i got some fear of technology .
that storytelling always took more sense .
i talked a lot about magic .
somehow the children don &apos;t do that .
we use the energy of the sun .
we saw some amazing presentations .
she was a daughter &apos;s daughter .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is probably going to be public trade .
my uncle died of alkoholinduzierten diseases .
many of my clients are very young .
this is a very sensitive question .
i talk a lot about these questions .
do you want dazukommen and listen ? &quot;
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started my usual talk .
you should also have a wish .
then he flüsterte me .
well , i went to the gerichtssaal .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
so the rate itself is accelerating .
&quot; a pale blue fee . &quot;
because we live on a wasserplaneten life .
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-milliarden-marke .
we have the passion of a diy-innovatoren .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropen .
we &apos;re expecting some extraordinary decades .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
it &apos;s the durchschnittsleistung of the schlägers .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
but , you know what ?
i was a zwanghaft student student .
she was back and dying .
slowly , it made sure .
i started feeling better .
alone , shame and support .
but there are two problems .
i don &apos;t take the same approach .
all of this is inevitable .
and it starts with a doctor .
they share their experience with others .
i am a new doctor .
people were still happy .
and that &apos;s what nobody seems to do .
zertifizierungsbehörde hacken , gefälschte ausstellen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument makes no sense .
lego made it possible for everybody .
and it was an incredible experience .
and of course , we all share the same anpassungsnotwendigkeiten .
a language is expression of the human mind .
54 percent of the deaths happened by durchbohrungen .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
you can &apos;t do anything like this .
but these are all the streets in the u.s.
now let &apos;s get something different .
many of you are covered by faces and so forth .
this is my supermarket . no big .
and there are several reasons for this .
here &apos;s some on the hamptons .
every one in my manhattener neighborhood is gone .
well , this cartoon makes some people .
the truth is more like this .
we started out 15 years ago .
it turns out it &apos;s very difficult .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
this is the evolution of evolution here .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
we konditionierten them , reparierten them .
like algae -- and other furchteinflößende things .
if not , somebody else &apos;s day .
his whole arbeitsprozess has changed .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
it &apos;s about a neuversorgung of america .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
so for him , they were just bauklötze .
we wanted to develop a lernmittel for sprachlerner .
so that was my primary motivation .
and the list can continue endlessly .
even longer than these other networks .
and that &apos;s really in the beginning .
what are the models of this ?
i want to show you this one .
this is what happens to the maschinenzeitalter .
on the book and on the picture .
we have an abstract language .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
maybe a little bit of a look behind it .
so , from modern in the computergesellschaft .
every society is shaped by a primärmedium .
at the beginning , the stammesgesellschaft through the language .
that the theme of ecology is a global issue .
so often in the third time , we forget .
you can see from the back .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
it has to only act as a present present .
how do i make something like that ?
and less usable or benutzungsfreundlich is it .
and what does that mean for designers ?
i &apos;m trying to do that by a beispiels .
well , everyone was eating cake .
and the curiosity is not going to learn .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , verbrauche less energy .
this is just a little less destruction .
and everything is packaging or content .
one baby needs about six thousand diapers .
so the men can &apos;t be pigs .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
that means we need to have phosphorus zurückkriegen .
but really , really , yes ?
that &apos;s why not resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
we &apos;re thinking about north .
so not saving , let &apos;s avoid .
you can show , i was there .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown right now .
there &apos;s a direct rücknamesystem for this .
if you come to that , yes ?
all over the place , these bracelets are around .
we can reinvent everything else .
so every concert is another concert .
there he and he said , &quot; right ?
he only lived for years .
we &apos;re barely talking about interpretation .
and it &apos;s still no interpretation .
tell that what they feel .
it &apos;s not just a nice geräuschtapete .
and this sounds quite different than before .
so the first step to an interpretation .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
because now you can use a dreisatz .
dreisatz , you know , still from school .
in this dreisatz , three sentences come from .
and you can feel it .
so he &apos;s in the middle .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
say , there &apos;s no vorhersager .
there was kernforschungsanlage leopoldshafen .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
you &apos;re like this box .
we also have very detailed data .
how far do you get there ?
and then we said , okay .
simple , it &apos;s going to come .
so i just started playing .
music is medicine . music is changing .
and so he entflieht his quälenden conditions .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
they have the reverse wind river .
here he picks up a rare gleitaar .
now , he mentioned the mineralbedürfnisse of phytoplankton .
i am an expert for relationships . &quot;
a fischaufzucht , but also a vogelreservat .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
it &apos;s this beißende , taste taste .
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
you can dive into a particular year .
we &apos;re talking about the oscar curse .
so , thank you so much .
i was totally wissenschaftsbegeistert , you know .
i could draw . i could paint .
i didn &apos;t let myself out .
so , they &apos;re sort of verflochten my two passions .
so , that really blew my mind .
we went back to the wreckage of titanic .
so that was a very strange experience .
we have something that doesn &apos;t increase .
for energy , i fell this one .
so here are some natural fireflies .
it should be the two elements again .
there &apos;s a lot of that coming together .
we need to use more research for more research .
anyway , we need a solution .
bg : a energiedurchbruch is the most important thing .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
but there &apos;s another reason .
because they have special skills of prozessbegleitung .
what did you think happened to these design-studenten ?
we repeated this practice with the same student .
and that can make a big difference .
and everyone in this room has to go in .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
it &apos;s not even the truth gets free .
we have measles now .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we &apos;re running into the poor of the placebo-industrie .
they go to thabo mbeki in south africa .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patentkram .
so , look what happens .
and the goal is very simple .
i hold the knife in my hand .
what ? that really blew me .
i would take the needle now .
everyone would like to make people happier .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
there seems to be a scourge .
we get this absolutely flat line .
so , thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
no , i mean it really seriously .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
so , we have 1.5 billion players .
five million people use it every month .
in front of these fantastic spielecontrollern , there were schafsknöchel .
people were hungry . people fought .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
they divided the kingdom in two camps .
here &apos;s the aktualisierte version of this eintrags .
we can give ourselves something like that .
maybe we can see widrigkeiten as a change .
but what is going on in the future ?
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
i remember my first fire .
and you know what i learned ?
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
intersexualität comes in many different forms .
so we have this awful vereinfachende idea .
they had a concept of blue blood .
we see the same thing with the behindertenrechtsbewegung .
how do you admire people from their charaktereigenschaften ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
do we really want to go to this ?
conditions of this kind of thing exist .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
just be just who you are .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
let &apos;s start with the interaction .
it was born four and a half years ago in italy .
it was as an italy that was the fußball-weltmeisterschaft .
and no matter , italy won &apos;t win .
second , the end of normal play .
zidane , in a moment of kopfstoß .
we called it the digital water pavillion .
the roof was covered with water as well .
you can do that all the time .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
but the truth is far away .
this is the average size of a grönland-eisbergs .
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
he can only use his eyes .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
this is something like our kampfschrei .
it comes from our own pockets .
and i had to go away from the city .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
he says , &quot; bereitmachen to grasp . &quot;
and that &apos;s the planning behind stuxnet .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
okay , so you really want to know ?
i went to prison -- difficult .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
so , it &apos;s not that optimistic .
what words would you describe ?
man 3 : i &apos;m the schmusetyp .
man 5 : brand alkoholsüchtiger alkoholsüchtiger schreiberling .
they brought up their pictures , yes ?
i like things that are different .
the first one is a classic , apple .
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
are they achtsam and mondän like 007 ?
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
emc : &quot; you welcome transparency . &quot;
thank you , but the best thing is .
you can get very easy in and rauszoomen .
but then you really want to go deep .
another lieblingsbild of mine , sternennacht .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
it &apos;s just too detailed to stimmen voices .
the rest of the time they are delokalisiert .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
also städtedesigner and -bauer are very interested .
they had 348 different types of marmelade .
and i want to read to you the ones .
my fourth technique : assumption for complexity .
oh my god . oh my god .
actually , bear didn &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share one rainbow .
even cats look at this video .
no one needs to give your ideas green light .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
no apple ever tasted this way again .
my mom was suffering from the boat .
i was not familiar with the etikette .
there had to be another puzzlestück .
a year we didn &apos;t have a dime .
we worked late to the night .
her father died soon after her birth .
&quot; they didn &apos;t lock them up . &quot;
secondly , two photos would have the same beleuchtungsart .
the bank is from a different place .
we have all the navigationssysteme in our cars .
and sure , we can find fastfood-ketten .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
oh , my time is over ?
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
and that worked . applause for scott .
scott committed to human beings .
beutelratte ? yes . live ? yap .
so every tröpfchen was a little different .
the zellengemeinschaften started to abstrahieren information again .
it could take place within a time .
speichere these off , lösche the rest .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
with 16 , i started to illustrate books .
it can know where we are .
i learned this from my grandmother .
there &apos;s a couple of hochinteressante developments .
we &apos;ve been running a lot of effort .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
i think our identity is threatened .
we want to do something against the death penalty .
we want to lower the number of deaths .
i &apos;m getting tired of how we all do .
he came to me and i came up .
that i had written these crazy things .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
it was the fehlgeleitete kreuzzug against drugs .
but maybe this is not the case .
child mortality has reduced to a tenth .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
now look at this curve .
notice two things about this curve .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
but the king of siam got aluminium-besteck .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silikate .
what are these three billion people bringing ?
now , this was a problem for supercomputers .
you know how to call a 400ter ?
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
and there are feedback to my oberarzt .
maybe i did it with good reason .
they barely breathe and was blue angelaufen .
they closed them up to the beatmungsmaschine .
she had failed gehirnschaden .
this is the kind of lehrreicher shame .
but i asked myself these questions .
why did i go to medicine ?
at one point , i thought he would have nierensteine .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
i thought i could integrate myself .
if you do it , this is what happens .
the difference is then perceived as a loss .
there can be a sequence of changes .
that &apos;s exactly what our goal is .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of natural animals .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
but western governments are also helping themselves .
but today we are far beyond that .
we &apos;ve also brought to designschulen .
the ethnosphäre is the great legacy of humanity .
now this level of intuition is very important .
it &apos;s our new household , and it &apos;s called nunavut .
every big picture is the beginning of a abschnitts .
or other models , or even technical specs .
übereinandergelagert on the erdräumlichen picture of nasa .
there are the ones that are much more nuanced .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
yes . it doesn &apos;t do anything else than discover .
the official glaubenssatz of all western industrialized societies .
i just want to briefly say something about salatdressing .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
in other domains , the world of communication .
we didn &apos;t inherit identity , we invent them .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
i could park directly before my house . &quot;
i wear jeans , almost the whole time .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing for worse .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask major questions .
it &apos;s a little virus killing the bacteria .
they laughed more than they do here .
so , this looks like a basketball-playoff .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it has a molekulargewicht of over 300 million .
it will provide a challenge for 9 / 11 .
we take images of these mini-urknalle into detectors .
it just didn &apos;t come before , you know ?
oh , jesus , what a thought !
everybody knew , your genius was paralyzed .
it &apos;s about the country on them .
if your job is dancing , it &apos;s tanze .
and if you don &apos;t , yet your dance .
it &apos;s growing in the winter and sped up in the summer .
this is the southwest stream in southwest greenland .
but we start to see a change .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
frosty , the kohlenmann will be cleaner every day .
this is one , part of you .
saueber coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean kohletechnologie .
versorge america . find out more .
we need to get far , and it &apos;s fast .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
and they also feel their movements and slope .
this is our youngest beta-tester down there .
now he &apos;s launching a tractor in the scene .
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit of drums .
i can change the sequence as it goes through .
i &apos;m very excited that i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
as i said , it just started .
and that &apos;s what they do .
now , if you &apos;re going to take a little bit further .
but i &apos;ll get to talk about that again .
then , the verblassenden einflüsse of vorindustriellen cultures .
what we &apos;ve been left is the storytelling .
i want to just tell you a little bit about this .
and the two letzteren are also here today .
it &apos;s a forschungssemester for the natural user interface interface .
to say , what is information ?
and on , you see it now .
this is what the norm says .
and there &apos;s a central point there .
so , of course , we can look at the müllproblem .
this is balanced in china a second .
because that &apos;s what it is , right ?
have you ever seen a klimaneutralen tree ?
we can support them , well .
that means that the verbrechensraten go back .
we can support them , well .
and we see that it &apos;s absolutely necessary .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
then i say , herzliches beileid , yes ?
but with the real design , please .
in two hours , she &apos;s building herself all over .
do you remember the windel again ?
it &apos;s sort of a beneficial poop print .
and in my jugendlichkeit , i said , accept .
the x-malige interpretation of a piece is like this .
especially when he died .
a phrase with his breath .
because the music instrument is the extension of our body .
because artists have a gestörtes relationship with the lie .
because we cannot live without those lebenslüge .
a particularly nice story , like me .
so she &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a word about reality .
we can continue to continue these things in different examples .
gleichgroße forces with gegensätzlichem vorzeigenzeichen solve each other .
and in berlin , there was a crazy ingenieurkollektiv .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
these were the very first calculations about six years ago .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we have 30 gigawatts today in germany .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violinkonzert .
it &apos;s hard to überbewerten the destruction .
he has a futterverwertung of 15 to one .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
it &apos;s great , but i was love .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your bäuche , pink .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
i mentioned this against miguel and he nickte .
now , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
you can be immersed in a decade .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
we talk about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
when i was a child , i drew comic books and so forth .
i was kind of obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
these blöden films don &apos;t make us money .
there &apos;s a connection , a sense of respect .
so what can we get out of all this ?
it &apos;s also very important for you .
isn &apos;t it half or a quarter ? &quot;
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
the last three of the five , i put it in .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
there are many great books to this topic .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
they lead the process , they understand it .
i thought , well , we get the same .
there was never a time like this .
my ur-großeltern everybody died when they were 60 .
my parents are the 80 to the fersen .
anybody even know what that is ?
this is skandalös and we should be ashamed .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
the guy in the middle isn &apos;t that much .
and they &apos;re not just going to die on measles .
we had no kinderlähmung in this country yesterday .
have you all taken your vitamins today ?
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo-industrie .
and i have all kinds of little subunits here .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
they have them . they always have them .
and some of it worked , and some of it doesn &apos;t .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
... that &apos;s also a role game .
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
people in the nebenräumen are now coming in .
well , the erinnernde self is a storyteller .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
thank you . i have a question for you .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil toledano .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
this is a little bit of a epischen victory .
i don &apos;t get in real life of this feedback .
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe .
players are masters in the spiders of social investors .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
what do you think happens next ?
antonyme : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good .
it was summer and i had shorts .
and then , of course , it &apos;s made click .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130.000 years .
in front of him , there is a beautiful spärlich showgirl showgirl .
i &apos;ve tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to rebuild health after a disease .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
at berkeley , we call these robots exoskelette .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
as i said , amanda is unser our elegs .
he &apos;s steel every fünkchen of my consciousness .
the dog ! i was amazed .
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressivität .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin
play is the kitt , which is beieinanderhält us .
look at what she does .
in other words , play is our anpassungsjoker .
so two pairs , each zeugt a baby .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to that .
they are in the back part of our body .
he had an extreme form of an innate nebennierenrindenhyperblasie .
we don &apos;t know why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
they moved to a naturalistischen concept .
but how do you do that in practice ?
so i think we need to be leaders .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
and i &apos;m going to wrap it up for you .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
well , we introduced the mayor of belloch .
here you see the building working .
i want to show you something here first .
at the same time , it &apos;s a echtzeit-3d-scan and a bewegungsaufnahme .
so that you can get the whole movement .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important .
ordinary people are not accessible . &quot;
make it possible -- all of you here .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a geräuschloses airplane .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bordpersonal .
i never want to move into life anymore .
you probably knew the schuhgröße of the maschinenbedieners .
it looks like altmodische assemblersprache .
so that made sense to fit together .
so again , it &apos;s really fine .
it &apos;s natanz and it &apos;s just natanz .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressiver .
so at this point we need digital sicherheitssysteme .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
i worked in a kohlebergwerk -- dangerous .
no , that was what i thought .
it &apos;s unvorhersagbar -- like this strange landstraße .
i want to help you calm .
you should tell me something about my brand .
well , what &apos;s the brand gerry ?
i sell schmusetiere throughout the country , around the world .
tell me a little bit about this part .
we should put the bear in the cage .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite feature .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
so the theme of the day , energy savings .
well , who is ready for this trip .
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzlestückchen .
but that &apos;s how many got over the years of aid .
life hasn &apos;t changed for centuries .
&quot; it turned out to be a unwahr .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
if i say reality , i &apos;m foto-realität .
and here is a very good piece of planned .
it has a button , right ?
i calculated my job with 95 kilos .
next week , this is coming on the market .
we have herumgefragt , and nobody knew it .
it might be , until it &apos;s loaded .
al is a hydrant in boston .
today a lot of people have given up government .
this is the call-center for service and information .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the beutelratten .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
and we use this word with such contempt .
... if you could just show the slide .
all of those were the ones that started .
the niederschreiben of dna was an interesting step .
the next step was happening within these communities .
so we &apos;ve got the zeitskalen back again .
say , &quot; please once again . &quot;
now we do this with bohrern and machines .
they were inspired by being inspired by them .
it can know how we hold it .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
she had the last word in every familienstreit .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
my grandfather was in prison in prison .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
assets , not verschulden , affects the outcome .
however , we seem to be quite pleased with that .
the death penalty is an interesting question .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
an amazing fehlerquote . one of nine innocent .
and yet , there are mental abkopplung .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
it was always so inspiring , so beflügelnd .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the classroom .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
right , bryan , the judge has zauberkräfte .
polizeibeamte came in and stellvertretende staatsanwälte and office workers .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
56 percent of all vergewaltigungsfälle don &apos;t come from trial .
nine : tsunamiwarnung . nine clubs .
different speakers . mass destruction . tornado .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
it &apos;s slowing down for neither of our big problems .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
i call them the coming billion .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
and this is very important in the medizinforschung .
and this game was played by universitätsprofessoren and so on .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
well , really good , maybe a all-star .
and that was not a very difficult diagnosis to stellenden .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s medical doctor .
and i went back to work .
the three words may remind you ?
i was shocked , and i was shocked by the inside .
and that was what i felt .
it was a lot of time , and i was a hurry .
it turned out to be a streptokokken-infektion .
he had potentially modified illness called epiglottitis .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
what you need is a new medical culture .
it supports when others talk about their mistakes .
i am a human . i make mistakes .
yet we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
they still describe the broschüren as an exclusive .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
they &apos;ll be less rare because we catch them .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
you can &apos;t put them wrong with them .
you just hear and start talking .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and the problem is not technology .
we had to make a worry about the lawyers and so on .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
if you want to build it between the images .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
to maximize freedom is freedom to maximize .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
but niederlassen is not always a bad thing .
your problem is that you have too little .
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfischglas . &quot;
our steps at standardize life was exponentially .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built waterzeichen .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
we &apos;ve tried to get the point of leadership .
this is not a elektronenmikroskopaufnahme , it &apos;s a reguläre mikroskopaufnahme .
these are footage from a time of six seconds .
we now focus on the fourth of the fourth generation .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
and they had to take away what we did .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
by march , the lhc will be funktionsfähig again .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
i may have another 40 arbeitsjahre in me .
not just bad , but the worst time .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
this is one of the schmerzhaftesten korrekturen of a creative life .
and „ olé ! “ for all of this .
but the volume is bigger than ever before .
this is 20 feet meereshöhe , like greenland .
trotzdessen is a political argument in our country .
one of the commercials of the kohleindustrie around christmas was this .
frosty is a vergnügter , happy fellow .
the most powerful bergarbeiter is the head of massey coal .
new investments for good paying jobs .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
i &apos;m looking forward to you all !
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself-bio dot org .
and then we &apos;ve been working on this code-of-conduct .
they virtualisieren reality , and it &apos;s very without computers .
and in this mind , the memory was remembered .
central tools of informationsvermittlung have been more likely to have stories .
and they did this with so-called lead-landkarten .
which was the language of language untergeordnet rang .
we &apos;ve moved to something called vogt-zeitalter .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
anyway , they do it in it .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at now .
we understood that the weather is global .
so how do we work when we go there ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
now , everyone &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
and sechzehn milliseconds , also a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s about to think about wiege .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the gdp is stored .
it &apos;s kind of them all in the vorwindelphase .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of waisenknaben .
because you know , this is a lustvoller process .
it &apos;s a form of revierverhalten , right ?
but today we only talk about the biological systems .
no , we put what &apos;s inside .
it &apos;s all that is useful .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because they &apos;ve changed now twice the vorstandsvorsitzenden .
so , help me a little bit .
interpreten are the übersetzer notes in klingende music .
in fact , the notes are very vague and ungenau .
you collect information about the play in the sekundärliteratur .
to keep zwiesprache , directly with the composers .
but maybe you can still do it .
can you now play it in blue ?
i have a friend that drives a passerati .
it just makes you think , and not yourself .
so , we can &apos;t really touch these things .
there &apos;s only the second second second , just the firemen .
this is the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
the first two sentences , they are logical correctly .
i can say , the kanzlerin is a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you what &apos;s true .
so if klaus says there &apos;s no soul .
however , that was not like that in the achtiziger years .
they have a renewables today from 15 percent .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go further and further .
and then it looks like this .
the goal was simply to say , okay , okay .
nobody has done that in the world .
and then a whole bunch of simulations did .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and that &apos;s the &quot; n &quot; a little bit .
and in time , they can react again .
then we have to break our capacity into the net .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
let &apos;s call it miguel , actually .
this is a fischaufzucht in the ecke corner .
they did this by entwässerten the country .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
now i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
and interestingly , bono also is a ted prize winner .
i grew up with a gehörigen portion of science fiction .
we &apos;re going to show it in the eröffnungssequenz of the movie .
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
and so i made a slightly unusual decision .
in the course of this voyage , i have learned a lot .
i think the first place is curiosity .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
so , a climate change becomes terrible for you .
well , the energiepreis is over time .
so this has got to go down to zero .
this is the u.s. bank for hundreds of years .
a lot of talk about 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
the hauptproblem here is kind of like aids .
three feet is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
now they understood the advantage of the arrow .
they produced the highest construction in the lowest time .
we have a machine here .
but you know where you don &apos;t have right ?
they were just like people in this room .
what happened is that we could do this .
well , i understand that . i do .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
this is a debatte debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
you know , there were no mandarinen in paradise .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 5,000 years .
yes , you &apos;re right . fix that .
you know that science is not a company .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
there &apos;s somebody sitting there who had no childhood .
really sorry . do you make it crazy ?
let me show you from the nearby .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
well , the erlebende self lives on their own lives .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
that &apos;s not how it works at all for itself .
the erlebende self has no voice in this choice .
we think about our future as a vorausgesehene memories .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s the dominant one .
well , their own self will not be happier .
the more money you make is happier .
this is a problem that many players have .
that constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
we &apos;re developing up to collaborative thinking .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
i just want to do that , that &apos;s logical .
what we want is to create the future .
so i say , let &apos;s start the weltverändernden games .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up doors ?
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
again , what potential do we want to buy now ?
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
raise your hands . let me see .
how many would choose for a good memory ?
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to be the longest life .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
so they &apos;re going ; they save the shoes .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our closest living relative .
we learn trust and the rules of the game .
but are we going to make the best of our spieltrieb ?
imagine that just for a moment .
we produce androgen and we &apos;re talking to androgene .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
i &apos;m a jessi , and this is my suitcase .
france does a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
this is something built in the city .
very rarely you actually witness a rollenden iceberg .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
tempt was one of the leading members of the 1980s .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- they walk along .
so i talked a few months later at a conference .
so they move around , and they make kunstinstallationen like this .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
now , there &apos;s all this rummel in the great unveiling .
and we have to make a lot better on this device .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingbroke .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
it was something that we knew .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t even do anything .
here &apos;s a clip from this angriffs- code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
these results were achieved by several weeks of work .
the idea is to fool a digital sicherheitssystem .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is generisch .
you could also use ordinary wurm- technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
so the driving force is the cyber- superpower .
i filmed in kriegsgebieten -- difficult and dangerous .
you know how many people see these tedtalks ?
it was &quot; in eternity forever . &quot;
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is probably going to be &quot; no . &quot;
no one wanted to do something with the film .
no , that was not the mistake at all .
and then we provide one of these great düfte .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
these are the people who shape my worldview .
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
there &apos;s a lot of kooks going on there .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
he &apos;s not in other countries .
you can look around in all these museums here .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , but in a second .
but what if you want to see the pinselstriche ?
you go in . you can really go in .
this is sternennacht , probably never seen before .
and that was a erfahrung experience for me .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side doesn &apos;t like it .
in the summer 2009 , honduras was suffered from a major major verfassungskrise .
he asked octavio to become a stabschef .
by the airport alone , it has a place of 100 quadratkilometern .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and careful .
a typical walmart gives you 100,000 products today .
i think i &apos;ve probably heard more hands .
because the images made it real sense for them .
three things : tastemaker , teilnahmecommunities and the unexpected .
it was taken almost 200 million times this year .
this year , it &apos;s almost taken 50 million times .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s put together .
my grandmother never forgotten me his life .
i didn &apos;t know how to use it .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
my mom called me a few minutes after that .
is it about the details or the colors ?
so i think the basics are very simple .
and let me show you a simple example .
and i see the same process combine with photographs .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
we know one another where all the gas stations are .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
he &apos;s like &quot; beutelratte &quot; in the official database .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real regierungsarbeit is happening .
we need to look at the machinery of government .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
these little öltröpfchen were in the sense of primitivste zellenform .
and try this whole generation with another generation .
and i get a character in the book .
fireflies in a glass i always found quite exciting .
and the light bulb is the way through the rest of the book .
it also shows itself in other places of the book .
at one point , the screen swims with leaves .
first , i thought that was a game .
we &apos;re just running around like this , as well .
in 1972 , 300,000 people in haftanstalten and prison were in prison .
i think , in my opinion , masseninhaftierungen has changed our world .
in many areas , people had to fear lynchmobs .
so these women were meeting , and they just talked .
and i walked over and just listened .
wr people want to help people who have been convicted .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
then i ask myself , how could that happen ?
and i have to say , there was power to me .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
bryan stevenson : well , there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
what would you tell somebody who believes ?
so the dramatic numbers come in the offenders .
recession . gridlock . doomsday . egypt . syria .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
so the amygdala is our early systems , our gefahrendetektor .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleons soldiers got silber-besteck , napoleon himself .
it &apos;s new nanotechnologien on the way , nano-materialien .
this is technologieunterstützte innovation that &apos;s there today .
what will they consume ? what are they going to do ?
i looked at ms. printers and she was in atemnot .
i hired them and made me care about treatment .
i remember being it yesterday .
both of them are nagten me , fraßen me .
some of my klöpse happened in the last five years .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
you know , he was 1835 here .
he described one of them as very common .
now it &apos;s in the red list of vulnerable species .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a big loss .
the question is why people accept this .
this is wladimir tsastsin from tartu in estonia .
somebody was hacked and hacked the system .
and that &apos;s what happened in the case of diginotar .
it was called the &quot; automatically rock &quot; .
a few years ago , i began to develop littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
and we want to do this material for all available .
we &apos;re all born . we bring kids to the world .
and the key bellwether for that is extinction .
but the waorani didn &apos;t only kill außenstehende with the spear .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you must protect it . &quot;
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all controlling mineralvorkommen .
this is a whole book , an example of nichtbild-daten .
and if possible , i will find some of the weird ones .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
now , do you know what the answer is ?
and we so often reinvent how we want to .
and the world we lived in .
do you want the buttons or reißverschluss ? rocks or acid ?
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
in fact , he can feel really paranormal .
she said it would be like a zug train .
he finished all the match and did something entirely new .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to be living in human .
and the proposal was to build a lot more kohlefabriken .
this is in our entire country of zweitgrösste abfallfluss of america .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
if we zoom in , we can zurückschütten a little bit .
here &apos;s another couple of people that test it .
this is not supposed to be a joke now , but .
now , what do we do for projects like this ?
i think it &apos;s kind of six or something like that .
so , i think it &apos;s a very gelungener hack .
and this is the kernanliegen of the biohackern .
this is already a relatively substantial number of people around the world .
how many doors did the house in which they live in ?
the only thing that they had was their head .
and life lived in the küstenregion of british columbia .
that means you &apos;re navigierte about sound and rhythm .
we have used to make things happen linear .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
i apologize that i need to shortcut so much .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s in there .
just like it happened before on the village .
and what &apos;s it in there ?
there &apos;s more to my glasses .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
that &apos;s the time you fall in love with it .
so , as a human being with certain kinds of things .
we could only glide as amorphe through the weltmeere .
in fact , if we don &apos;t do phosphorus , we can make no phosphorus .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
that means that the ants weigh a lot more than us .
there are still six and a half billion trees alone .
because the frankfurter plant could best return the phosphorus .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
we &apos;ve now been using us for three years now .
and the oil we &apos;re being able to replace by others .
no , it &apos;s just the right thing , right ?
they can wegschmeißen where they go and stand .
in the countries where people come to money .
i can &apos;t play as much as in 20 years today .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
it &apos;s loud and leisezeichen , etc . , etc .
so the hammerköpfe in the piano is the sequel of my fingers .
the dauernde berieselung today with music is not förderlich .
so , i wonder , how fachlich was that diagnosis ?
whether the music is too gepfeffert or too sweet .
and that was the very first beginning of a musical expression .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford &quot; n little car ? &quot;
and then i immediately fall , that &apos;s unfair .
the spanish painter pablo picasso once has a woman .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
we actually know that something else is the case .
the soul is kind of intellectual , says about leibniz .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
because actually , this man isn &apos;t interested in evidence .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have any more ?
the conventional system looks like this throughout the world .
and then we started to negotiate with the insulanern .
have to negotiate with investors , and i &apos;ve looked for a new school company .
we can also aufschalten kilowatt kilowatts on the web .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies .
this first one , that was more like a passionate type of mind .
i had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
this futterverwertung from 2.5 to one , he said .
&quot; 2.5 to one thing ? what is it feeding ? &quot;
i was eating him first in a restaurant restaurant restaurant .
a befreundete journalist has been talking for a long time .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
i wasn &apos;t a long time ago with miguel .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely selbsterneuernd .
so the equivalent of the gut , the better the system . &quot;
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
because if the water is herausfließt , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
so i go back , and i &apos;ll take a step back .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the top wikipediaseiten .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s all good to do with these science-fiction-rolle gepasst .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t get yourself one .
probably one of those numbers has to come very close to zero .
the second factor is the services we use .
i &apos;ve got rid of the tides , geothermal , nuclear and biofuels .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
there are some innovations in the nuklearbereich , modular , liquid .
let &apos;s think about how we measure our success .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
a very specific wish , that we invent this technology .
where is the biggest interest in what really do ?
this is a figure of one thing that was made .
those who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
specialized skills and prozessfähigkeiten and their combination lead to success .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and i took a while to figure that out .
these were umsichtige people , educated people , decent people .
these are many deaths by measles , 20 per hour .
he befreite us from one of the worst geißeln of humanity .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
they verdunkeln their urine . they almost never do .
so we &apos;re running away from that , and where are we going ?
there was no weihnachtsbäume . we did it all .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give you .
maniok is something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s just a cluster of calories . it &apos;s stealing .
anyway . i want everybody anyway .
i &apos;m going to explain it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
i &apos;m going to hold the knife just like this .
probably many of you here know that trick in the room .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo-effekt ?
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
this is my flesh , and i can do that .
the first of these dropping is a widerstreben , complexities .
what had been ruins was the memories of the experience .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
it has moments of erlebens , one after another .
most of them are completely ignored by the erinnernden themselves .
the biggest difference between them is to deal with time .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
so i want you to think about a thought thought .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
i mean , i &apos;ve just seen as flat lines .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with online-spielen .
ok , imagine how extreme selbstmotivierung .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
and this is an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and these were the first of the people who were developed .
so , i think we &apos;re going to play a game today .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
this is an amazing adventure that you go to .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global aussterbungs- sensibilisierungs-system , &quot; of course .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use a synonym-wörterbuch at that time .
they bring them to open doors .
and that &apos;s what it was like after the three months .
how would it be to live longer with good health ?
is it true to other people , or is it ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
our gut is an amazing environment for these bacteria .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
how could it be that we do this ?
so imagine just two other little changes .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known under primates .
in most of my operations , i have two hüte .
and that &apos;s why the testes in the fötalen are giving testosterone .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as girls .
in our observation , we get in all sorts of unbequemen areas .
we see this in all sorts of different parts of human life .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
obviously it &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a bildpunkt , flying .
this is what they would call , in ingenieurteams , a echtzeit-kontrollsystem .
here are the results that we have right now .
but that &apos;s a lot of unnützer transporte and more complicated things .
did anybody see the film &quot; butterfly &quot; ?
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
since that time , we have all sorts of recognition .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i said , &quot; please flieg in the air . &quot;
and i feiere , i swear like a little kid .
and in the world , there was a sense of me .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i want to tell you how we found this .
these zentrifugen in iran are embedded in the so-called 15 types of planes .
and guess what we &apos;ve found in the angriffscode ?
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human maschinenführer .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to imagine .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i don &apos;t know how people will be empfänglich .
how much money is needed to realize that ?
they absolutely didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
so , how exactly are we going to see in the movie ?
are you ? you see a little nervous .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
what about me ? what about the druchschittstypen ?
this is my brand in my little , verzerrten industry .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
a little more about you that are not you .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
a achtsame , verspielte brand . how is your brand ?
and how was that for you ? what it was successful ?
this is just online -- no press , no television .
it &apos;s not even online . no streaming .
finally , when you &apos;re working , we should welcome to fear .
click , and wumms , you &apos;re in this museum .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called the collections .
this is the gesandten , in the nationalgallerie .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
look , let me give you an analogy .
so quantum mechanics says that unbewegliche objects are alike .
and we found that it was really strange .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what really awesome .
there &apos;s more than that , it goes deeper .
now , we &apos;re far away from that goal .
all parties , all the fraktionen of society , supported this .
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
it was a store called draeger &apos;s .
this business , it was almost like a vergnügungspark .
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing regalfläche .
well , let me show you a little bit more about this .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
i &apos;ll show you one example of what i mean .
autofarben of the car -- i &apos;ve got 56 opportunities .
and this video was actually sent in january in january .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endlosschleife .
and that all leads us to a big question .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was completely disconnected that it could fail .
after three months in a refugee camp we landed in melbourne .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i made the decision to go to the u.s.
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
but you can combine something special like this .
for example , the fish had been taken on a anglerausflug .
this is my wlan-waage . a very simple thing .
and over 10,000 aeds have been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps for this .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other regierungstechnologie .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and it &apos;s verbreitet , of course , organic , of course .
but what happened to &quot; citizens connect &quot; is different .
turned the mülltonne on the page . went home .
this is great . here &apos;s the physical the physical .
let &apos;s call the tierfänger , it costs a lot of money .
so , if you could turn the lights back again .
in fact , we &apos;re such a mehrzellige community .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
so nowadays , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
so in other words , i define what i want .
so , find programs that can most easily occur to numbers .
and finally , i get to get programs that can be perfect numbers .
and yet we don &apos;t understand the possibility of this yet .
the kid in me is really excited about this opportunity .
you can say things that have influence in the world .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
it was also the beginning of many differences in our family .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also a trusted .
i remember it was like it was yesterday .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justizsystem .
the united states today has the highest inhaftierungsrate of the world .
i &apos;ve kept some talks in germany in the death penalty .
he said , &quot; there &apos;s no death penalty .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go to injustice .
we want to eliminate lebenslängliche haftstrafen without a living environment for children .
even who kills someone , not just a murderer .
sometimes i lose the balance . a story to end .
i had a 14jährigen , poor black boys as clients .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
we have hinreißen from the rhetoric of punishment .
and i think that our current bestrafungsphilosophie doesn &apos;t help .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
i love this : &quot; watson bezwingt human enemies . &quot;
it &apos;s about understanding the sprache of language .
it &apos;s about making from halfway goods .
so let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
16 terawatt energy prasseln all 88 minutes on the earth &apos;s surface .
he took a very famous photograph . how did it mean ?
there &apos;s a program that some might already know .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and the whole time i collected more and more .
and when i got her zuhörte , she made geräusche sounds .
i went back to the notfallabteilung on my way home .
if you do wiedergutmachung and you never make the mistakes again .
and she said three words : do you remember ?
in a notfallschicht , i &apos;ve missed two blinddarmentzündung .
in both cases , operierte and it was very good .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of umgänglichen mistakes .
and at the end , you only want to get the erbärmlichen remains .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
and the motives of online-kriminellen are very easy to understand .
in the future , most crimes will go online .
there we are , like the diginotar of diginotar .
now , how are people dying of a dirty person ?

littlebits are electronic modules that have a specific function .
but wait , this is really my lieblings-projekt .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
christianity , islam , buddhism , judaismus or whatever .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a e-buch .
there &apos;s a series of photographs somewhere here .
they get a model that comes out of the entire earth .
one consequence of that was that the phone was never broken .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the world we see now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world over the last generation .
a chromosome is just a piece of inertes chemical material .
that &apos;s the publication that we just finished recently .
there are enzymes that are called the restriktionsenzyme that actually digest dna .
it turns out it &apos;s blue because of the genes we put together .
on the last ted conference , i was an introduction to the lhc .
these wires are leiten ampere when the machine runs on hochleistung .
and i don &apos;t expect that it &apos;s ever going to change .
a profound statement that you can do about your work .
i would rather be doing this work that i love .
this quest led me to the old greece and the old rome .
the greeks named these göttlichen diener-geister of creativity „ dämonen .
if your work floppte -- not completely your fault , right ?
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
but even i did this thing in my inbox sometimes , sometimes .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i don &apos;t do it . “
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
i started thinking , i should just einstampfen the project .
i &apos;ll keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
in 25 years it &apos;s going to be disappeared here .
in the andes , this glacier is the trinkwasserquelle for this town .
but if you versiegen , most of the drinking water is wegfallen .
so the alliance has created two campaigns in life .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s still fine .
versorge america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
so if i put them side-by-side , they get their interest .
most people know what most people are familiar with .
and then i took a sahnespender and it &apos;s connected to it .
so i know some of you don &apos;t have .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
and the third area , which explains itself .
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change .
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of gottes to virtualisieren .
and other examples are the ambienten , intelligent systems .
these are the spaces that can respond to a human being smart .
and of course , what it &apos;s like is , it &apos;s extremely entgegenkommt , and it &apos;s a computer game .
but i &apos;m just going to make it a little bit more curious .
and of course , how does design influence the perception .
gestaltgesetz of the , gestaltgesetz of the continuity and so on .
and that &apos;s then there , again , that comes back .
so that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve described to you about .
and that &apos;s the projection of vision , rückkopplung , vision .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
this is the time of most perceptions that we have .
the less i kind of think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
and because we &apos;re getting older , it &apos;s getting bigger .
this is what the more you say , the better you .
did you hear about the trees of trees ?
you can only have nullemissionen if you &apos;re not there .
even if they would shoot themselves , they would have emissions .
because it &apos;s a unfreundlich to go and take a ride .
that &apos;s natural , of course , but the plants are carrying themselves .
these are sechsundzwanzig countries that are controlling 40 percent of the population .
it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you wegwirft the wrong things , you have a müllproblem .
if you walk , yes , every footprint destroys the ground .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
because we don &apos;t do the things that are free .
as a interpretin , i first got the geschriebenen notes .
the notierten notes have the function of the letters of a script .
the work of the interpreten begins is kind of like a theaterregisseurs .
i play erklärend , which are these notes .
i &apos;m going to take the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
then the same thing happens in a good , angeregten conversation .
i &apos;ll never play more like that at the moment .
i wonder that you often forget something very much .

or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
so please listen , if a music is played .
there was no piano at all at the time as an instrument .
and also , what you would think of today in the mind .
that &apos;s already the first year of his value .
and then stone stones , so he gives you the view of the view .
from that time , an anecdote you might know .
the person should have abstammen or a common ancestor .
you feel that &apos;s the real truth behind .
this is what i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he agreed .
but of course , it &apos;s the sum , of many ideas .
in the back of the time , the jülich was called kfa .
because a good engineer has built great cars or atomkraftanlagen .
it comes from asia , which is the case of japan .
and we can put two milliseconds in the same battery two milliseconds .
and then you can see what enormous power there is there .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
so you could feel like to sell it .

this is the one that arbeitserfahrung in two billion years .
because they are the ones who are experts for flavor .
and i immediately see a different pattern that &apos;s going on .
you like to test it for my talk in your room .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
so i can zoom in in my course in a certain place .
but i really wanted to wrack the titanic to the titanic .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio did not know that .
this wasn &apos;t a movie , no hd , that was real .
well , they were also hochtechnisch and more sophisticated planning planning .
so that &apos;s what i got really excited about , and i wanted more .
in fact , the set was a genaue copy of the ship .
it changed my way to make films completely .
you have to be ready to take risks like this .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
it &apos;s the renewables that they &apos;re often called .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the target ?
the uranium is used gradually , a little bit like a candle .
a nuklearreaktor , which provides a solution for the waste .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
and that &apos;s a train i think is appropriate .
and they spend a lot of their time extending structures all over the place .
konstrukteure recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of a iterativen vorgangs .
ceos lie on average . but here it gets interesting .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
that &apos;s where the same , bad team of one under the best .
so , there should be a nine at the beginning of my todeszahl .
and soon , i wrote an article about gentechnisch food .
ask , ask the evidence , demand evidence .
there were tons of studies done to see if that was true .
a lot of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
does anyone in the audience have ever seen anyone in the audience ?
no fear , no qualen , kinderlähmung , jumping , disappeared .
he has just developed a couple of other people with a rotavirus-impfstoff .
what about kinderlähmung ? let &apos;s do that . why not ?
and we should not . our healthcare system is stealing .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
i mean , let &apos;s say , why do we fight that ?
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
and when i umdrehe , the fingers change his position .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show you your friends and neighbors . thank you .
okay , let me give you a little bit of blood for you .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to it . thank you very much .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
and my talk today is mainly about these cognitive traps .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
these are actual patients taking a painful procedure .
from the point of view , b has clearly had a worse time .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
so you can ask : how happy is the erlebende self ?
we know something about what happiness is determined for .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we were looking at how feelings handle income .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
my inspiration comes from an event that lasted for 2,500 years .
there are these ancient markings , from schafsknöcheln . you know ?
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
i want to say we &apos;re ready for our own episches game .

this is the world of the wild bonobos in the drc of congo .
now , if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , play may be at the end of the game .
now , under a hat , i &apos;m involved with the story of anatomy .
and as a general term , we can use the word intersexualität .
and the nebennieren are stellen , which are virilisierende hormones .
if you weren &apos;t moving , you &apos;ve buried it .
we &apos;re still finding other merkwürdigkeiten on what their rights are .
but a lot of people caught in a very strange position .
now in practice , people are not tested in their chromosome .
i mean , what is somebody doing with so many outfits ?
i brought in seven underpants , and this is all .
and i &apos;d like to show you what i want you to do for this week .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
if you &apos;re happy , you take other happy people .
i &apos;m smiling and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
so there &apos;s no excuse for anyone here in this audience .
when we live cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
you see in the middle of the middle , the fluß tiber .
now , we know everything about where our things come from .
but we only know a little bit about where things go .
they &apos;re doing something like a wasservorhang with bildpunkten water .
but in fact , this night , it was a greater fun one .
imagine that these bildpunkte could really start flying .
this is what we want to use as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
they interact in certain ways with their environment and their experiences .
as a iceberg melts , i schmilzt his vorzeitliche atmosphere .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate now ? &quot;
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .

i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
the idea behind the stuxnet is pretty straightforward .
so we should better find out what the goal is .
they knew all bits and pieces that they had to attack .
now , in this area there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
and neither the maschinenführer , it &apos;s not going to notice .
he has nothing to do with zentrifugen , with urananreicherung .
they lie in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the zielreichsten environments .
now this brand , the qualcomm stadion , the staples center ...
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of statten .
there are some places that we can turn to .
but what this picture is , is a problem .

they &apos;re in there , they want to go to the end of the gang .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
there &apos;s still a lot of others , but i don &apos;t have time .
for example , this one would be completely logical .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
that &apos;s the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
they could try to extend the capacity of existing apartments .
of course , each of these themes was , of course , many , many smaller decisions .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
we put a little verkostungsecke directly on the entrance of the geschäfts .

the beschaffung of software takes a few years to do it .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
politics is not changing ; government is in change .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if a neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
what is this new state that &apos;s going to take place the world ?
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .

with your chemiker-blockade , john -- how do you deal with this ?
please follow me , because the circle will end again .
so the people in the west have really been thinking about creativity for a long time .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .

but then , sukzessive came to this font as a primärmedium , erhielt .
and these two worlds are just crossing , new and old thinking .
but no longer on the local level , but on global level .

until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentiniern .

i said , &quot; do you don &apos;t whistle your fish ? &quot;
it &apos;s the last defense , before something happens in the body .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
and who is looking at that is that this is true in men .
but even in that limited view , we can do a lot of things .
so i decided to be a 15 , diver .

normally you &apos;re just going to be wrong and some come , others don &apos;t .
now , i wondered , how can i really get that ?
now , where are we going to go : what is the right approach ?
what we need is a lot of companies that work on this . hundreds of companies .
if we go back from there , what should the 2020 look like ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different camps .
most people usually start to orient themselves on the task .
so i offered a $ 10000 prize for the winner .

smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a wunschdenken .

you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
she wouldn &apos;t kill her kid against kinderlähmung . no way .
why ? because we don &apos;t have kinderlähmung . and you know what ?
echinacea , a little antioxidantium that helps you on the runway .
well , i think i understand the drug industry .
please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
and then people could eat the food and not be blind .
a deception becomes a little real , because somebody is aware of it .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .

they were asked to report all 60 seconds of their pain .
what a story is about is umbrüche , significant moments and end .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
that will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though it &apos;s heard .
how can we train these feelings from play into reality ?
so that allows the zusammenspielen to grow from bonds , trust and with each other .
players love to be part of awe gebietender missionen &apos;s assignments .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
it &apos;s a online-spiel where you have to overcome a ölknappheit .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
we degradieren people who have value for our society .
ah , the majority . i like to be a doctor .

there are 68 million people who are advising the world in the wheelchair .
he said , &quot; bezos , you &apos;ve got to go to the house .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
so here we see a young female and males in a verfolgungsspiel .
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
so sexspiele are distributed , both in bonobos and people .
to be successful in a world , we need to be able to play .
and as a consequence , the body evolves more the typical female process .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
okay , just a quick example of a version of intersexualität .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualismus .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualismus .
and it makes me tense in terms of thinking about democracy .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s going on with the gründungsvätern .
and with that , they have really , really wonderful the future civil rights movement .
so how are we going to ask the question of the character of character ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
this is what we call in our lab , wahrnehmbares design .
halbzeit , people make a short call , go on toilet .
we can do the same thing in actually less energy .
imagine that every single person is being run .
it &apos;s a physikalisches shape in london , but with bildpunkten .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
i &apos;m like , &quot; very archaisch , how can that be ? &quot;
now , each paralyzed can actually communicate with its eyes , or draw .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempts room .
we parked his bed , so it can see out .
that &apos;s keeping us on the shelf , and we continue to keep growing .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s an amazing one .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve it .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
almost as if we prepare our lives for that .
i was given the miracle of not dying at that day .
the gray boxes that you see here are echtzeit-kontrollsysteme .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .

thank you for having a heidenangst eingejagt . thanks ralph .
but , apart from this , it &apos;s a very good opportunity .
and the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;

i like a lot of black colors , lots of grautöne and stuff .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was ausliefere .

this is actually one time of two or two weeks .
each one of the big spoon full of the way we welcome the risk .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
when the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion bildpunkte , i think .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again , in new york .
well , i &apos;ll play with you sometimes , but not very often .
i &apos;m going to zoom it up here . we look at the center right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to go all these extensions .
in the meantime i was preparing to talk to tedglobal .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and a new city includes new opportunities for leaders .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you ted .

now , why do we draw graphs in technology on semi-logarithmischen curves ?
and every organism is used exactly the same letters and the same code .

i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the verbindungsmaschine .
now , all of the übriggebliebenen people who have the numbers of numbers are the best sortiert .

because scarcity is kontextbezogen , and technology is an energy force force .
in 2010 , we &apos;ve been dealing with two billion people online .
how about a sentence of new , never before gehörter voices .

i looked in the rachen and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and i sent him on .
&quot; do you remember the patient with the gereizten rachen ? &quot;

they &apos;ve recently seen corn in ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
it will transform co2 in methane by using hydrogen as electricity source .
and it turns out the wires , and the wires realized suddenly elektrischem resistance .
i think it &apos;s better if we save our great creative creative .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
be continue for your contribution , whatever it is .
i believe in it and i feel like we should teach this .
in a sense , the arctic eiskappe is the schlagende heart of our global klimasystems .

so the device you see there doesn &apos;t work .
the interesting thing is , if i can make a little trip .
still , we &apos;re a very , very , very , very , very strong , informationsvermittlung .
and that &apos;s also what i had in half a year .
so i &apos;ve been busy when i was , of course , or intuitively .
the next generation of graphischen benutzungsoberflächen has been working much more with behavior .

although i &apos;m in the firemen , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
now i want to tell you what we found in my institute .
it &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t stop from stop , natural nature .
and so to lie that you can just apply these logic wrong .
but the crucial thing is , if i was right , it &apos;s right .
and now our conscious consciousness feels immediately , you can do something .

but as you talk to different people in the world about these possibilities .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later for that .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , just like little bit of supporting it .
if you put an administrator on the team , you get significantly better .

we &apos;re talking ironic about these little quotes : &quot; progress . &quot;
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect and correlation .
we love to lie in lies . we love that .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .

not like me , i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more busy .
we &apos;re putting games in order to get the real world of the real world .
they were playing a würfelspiel , and they were allowed to break up a epischen adventure .
for 18 years , they were playing for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute for the future .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me such playing and play .
so , again , change and customization are the greatest skills of people .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and the a student will get charged by the better teachers , getting the better teachers , etc .
the very key to this study was that teachers were not eingeweiht .
which would you like to have if you could only have one ?
a few . probably as many as many as the creative people here .
evolution priviligiert the creatures that adapt to their environment .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a verlockende , fascinating and terrifying opportunity .
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it to make these changes in your genes ?
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
but it &apos;s also about aging population whose number multiplied .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the human evolution in the narrative of human evolution .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction also have the survival of the bonobos .
bonobos -- like people -- love their lives for their lives .
first of all , a ballspiel on bonobo-art -- and i don &apos;t think about fussball .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s no such test .
we have two creatures , both the middle of 1979 in the same day .
i get all my clothes from the second hand on flohmärkten and in second-hand-shops .
what &apos;s interesting today is the echtzeit-kontrollsysteme start in our lives .
well , in this night , all the center went to celebrate .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re still going to throw away every day .
and we got the mission to design a building building the expo .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what happens inside .
on the left , you see the bildpunkte , the different eingefangenen sensations .
and just like this , the iceberg gives you a different page of his personality .
my life is really extraordinarily blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of constraints .
we set up a projektor file against a wall of the hospital in front of the hospital .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
i &apos;m sad that we never met each other as adults .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and this gave us great confidence that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like that .
and often we ran into a dead and we had to collect ourselves .
so the idea of this is obviously not only , the maschinenbediener in the control room .
we need to make the consequences and we &apos;re going to start doing better .
so despite these warning , i knew anyone would buy the namensrechte .
these people will be connected to the film in eternity forever .

the other place that was very interested in urbanism is singapore .
a million people every year of latin america and go to the united states .

and we found that there was actually a correlation .
you know , the average supermakrt today gives you 45,000 products .

and not even like a technik-unternehmen , but rather than the internet itself .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started this program .
you normally get out of your town when you were in your town .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve chosen out of my folder .
in other words , every step here is a power in the leistungsskala .
and this is what i want to look at on the earth &apos;s side of life .
this is also why the consistency grows to antibiotics .
we have a lot of cells that are not left on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , cell cells and so on .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
this is what we put in the machine in the machine , which is what &apos;s going on in the mikrosekunden-bereich .
because their life depended on whether they did the right job .

i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and we &apos;re going to make it look real .
you can see it right now , but you can also see , if you want to .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re going to tell stories .
now , this is a direct conflict between the erlebenden self and the erinnernden self .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we &apos;re on this world .
now , the erinnernde self makes more than remember and telling stories .
this is one of the explanations for the dominance of the erinnernden itself .
if you &apos;re asking for happiness itself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
well , you would know about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
in the sense of the other self , the erinnernden self , you get another story .
in the united states , you &apos;re looking at the erlebnis-glück of the population of the population .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might have some of the nuances in this picture .
we think we &apos;re not so good in the reality of play .
and i found some things that won the epic break in online-welten , so possible .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s people who believe they can change the world .
according to herodotus games , games , genauer , in the kingdom of lydien during famine .
we &apos;re going forward to epische , and we give people the opportunity to reach them .
so , what do we actually want to do -- an excellent person or a powerful person ?
and i want to deal with no one of the impact , or the heavy of a human race .
and he said , &quot; well , you might hardly remember me .
the real meaning of worts &quot; origins &quot; in the word &quot; educe . &quot;
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who are still sehnten after more creativity .
these are decisions with their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , to deal with .
so let me introduce to you now -- or the human universal universal load .
one over all of the maßen kindness of kindness : somebody had actually brought a few shoes .
women , like men , have something in our bodies that you call adrenalindrüsen .
so we have these permanently anatomischen categories that are in many ways and questionable .
if all the answers are loud , i feel like i won .
a week for exactly a week , everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the carbon emissions -- to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have people with our environment .
now , today , our environment begins for the first time to answer us .
and if we show that people , then we can push behavior behavior .
imagine that everyone can give a small donation for a bildpunkt .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to get a scientist .
imagine a big explosion as you climb up on 1,000 feet .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on 1d .
and i was thinking about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with windows-software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
basically , it &apos;s going out on the buschehr nuclear power and the urananreicherungsanlage in natanz .
we need digital sicherheitssysteme where a human being can &apos;t react fast enough .
so unfortunately , the largest number of goals is not in the middle east .
in my opinion , the mossad is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to the end .
and i would love to be happy if there would be some help to do this .
but is it a difficult thing to do because of the film or a difficult thing for me ?
our politicians tell it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to that , it &apos;s meant to change something .
if dan is a brand , it would probably be a classic mercedes-benz .
i &apos;m part of venus , partially yogi , part of brooklyn-mädchen -- i don &apos;t know .
they have helped companies like nestle , febreze , hallmark , to discover these markenpersönlichkeit .
you don &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
you &apos;re going to do it ? you &apos;re something that your blood gets in wallungen ?
i have felt that we have to encourage people to take risks to take risks .
i went close , and i noticed that these kids actually hit something .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be split in two halves .
how do we develop these intuitions ? well , we love playing with things .
he was a toddler , and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he fell all the time .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the big objects around us .
so i made this thing in a similar way to make a computer chip .
what does it mean to vibrate at the same time , and not digitize ?
only for about 12 percent of your decisions needed an hour or more of your time .
today , i want to talk about one of the largest entscheidungsprobleme of our modern time , the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem .
now , before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
here &apos;s for example , a study we &apos;ve done in a zeitschriftengang .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
just like &quot; double raindrop &quot; seems to be out of nowhere .
well , tosh.0 gabelte , many blogs started writing about it .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that &apos;s in the internetkultur of the techies and geeks .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his work .
the next puzzleteil show shows how a boat in the early winter cell was staying on sea .
as most adults in the boat carried my mother , my mother had a little giftflasche .
so i talked about jugendarbeitslosigkeit and education , and the vernachlässigung of the marginalisierten and entrechteten .
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through women .
now i would like my own kids , and i still think about the boat .
because , of course , this is a picture you can &apos;t take with your camera .
photos where you have to think a short moment to figure out the trick .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic controls fail .
there &apos;s going to be a little blutdruck-messgerät that you can do on a iphone or something .
and my little startup wants us to make a sense of environmental power .
now -- we can skip this -- i &apos;ll just skip the video .
so he did what every good programmer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s got an app , a web- and handy-app , called citizens connect .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
so this neigten , longer to survive , and it &apos;s expanding in more advanced ways .
and the veranlagten these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
so , as an example , as an example , the raffinierteste version of this is the human language .
we say , &quot; computers , generiere , please get a hundred million randomly selected sequences of instructions .
but one of these likes to be two numbers of luck in the right order back .
we know it &apos;s not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silberne taschenuhr .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped her view of a lot .
she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me only three things , bryan . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise . &quot;
i had what , your sister had what . go to a beer .
he said , &quot; grandma tells all the grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of our actions in the context of context .
but think of a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we do that . so we are so rational , so much we value intellect .
she said , &quot; and what will you do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
we need to make ways to make these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discussing .
even though aluminum 8,3 takes it , it &apos;s not as a purely metal metal .
and if we have a energieüberschuss , we &apos;ll also have water in the abundance .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
but now the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of excess .
and after two , three days , she realized she would never be back in awakening .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , she developed the geschehenen .
and then in my worst moments : how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
as you can see , the lagoon of palmen and a few mangroves were umsäumt .
my third little story talks about my mittäterschaft at the introduction of schleppnetzfischerei in southeast asia .
within a year , you have an elevation and then starts with the commercial fishing .
there &apos;s a little fish over time , and we think that &apos;s the normwert .
they found an article with falschem gedankengut , they could find the creator of this thought .
the second largest angreifergruppe we can see today is not motivated by money .
these are the questions we have to do for the next 50 years .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wires .
add this buzzer for an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a lärmmaschine .
but interesting is the unique manifestation of the liedes , the rhythm of dance in each culture .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
the suffering can be intolerable , but the erlösende mind of people is a little bit more unvergessliches .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species existed for 600,000 years .
the gleitschienen of her sled were originally made out of fish that was made in karibu-haut .
this is a project called photosynth , which actually connects two different technologies together .
you know , i never believed that i will ultimately work at microsoft .
we now have almost an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
should i be married ? should i only have children , or do i have kids ? &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to get a little bit bad about that .
you want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; damn the man thinks &quot; it &apos;s august .
when they came in 100 ways , it &apos;s very strong , one of them should have been perfect .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
if you break the goldfischglas , so everything is able to get rid of happiness .
does it allow the chemistry to create these really large molecules , which hasn &apos;t been done before ?
it actually took a few years of starting with a bioethischen review before we did the first experiments .
the viral particles were then released by the cells and came back and killed e. coli .
i &apos;ve talked to the oil industry recently , and they said they were doing this model model .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the lichtmikroskop .
the elektronikindustrie had a dozen components , and look at the diversity of that .
but the same thing is that we &apos;re working on using the same approach for developing vaccines .
in one of the links between neuntausend magnets in the lhc , there was a manufakturdefekt .
the microclimate and verzerrt whole egos and it creates all these unerreichbaren expectations of success .
maybe a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
if you want to know how sea level goes up , it &apos;s going to go into the ocean .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series i &apos;m using with a simple gleichungsprogramm noise .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle .
it &apos;s a story with open end and it can decide how to evolve .
and finally , i can abschließend the whole sequence by running the left to the left .
so it was a curiosity , and i kind of got to get closer to the matter of matter .
but always , always the approach to that it should be simple and accessible .
and what are our values and what are our candidates , our foundation ?
so it &apos;s not the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically machbar .
they don &apos;t have any lead-landkarten , but they have used this so much , or they have traumpfade .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from the top a to b ?
and what happens is the maschinenzeitalter and happens is the book , and it &apos;s the fotolitografie .
that sounds very spacig , and it sounds like science fiction , i know .
you can tell the same much better , because there &apos;s more to it .
so many people use the word , but they don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going on .
important for the designers , they have the most of the time , the great gestaltgesetze .
so , it sounds very banal , but it &apos;s kind of exciting when you get closer to it .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s really just seen .
so there &apos;s some practical functions , so formale things , or formalästhetische things .
that &apos;s what the whole thing did , but it &apos;s also a lot better , of course .
that means we &apos;re losing about five thousand times more than a new age .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back in cycles .
you know , there are two countries that are controlling almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
at any point where you go , you know , you &apos;re lebensmöglichkeiten , you &apos;re going to get back .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that it would take through the slope of biodiversity to biodiversity .
a television , or a washing machine , they use it , they don &apos;t use it .
i said , you know , you need to have about the same as the spoken language .
well , you can see , all of you , there must be no one candidate candidate .
or that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing today , because what you might have thought .
why do we need to find out that people experience from something , when it &apos;s true ?
but we know when we call that , the social issue is very sensitive .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that should be working .
so we should think of it as something that should be present to our lives .
so the second sentence is , if klaus is right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , that &apos;s dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
and i brought to you a project that i &apos;d like to introduce you to now .
you can , of course , if you &apos;re being trained in some kind of way .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on with a normal , stinknormalen battery battery .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild a society .
that means we were looking for the largest battery in the world .
it &apos;s not , you know , schwachsinn , kinderspielkram , we &apos;re never going to be involved .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a autarkes system .
and the reality of that expression is all about us , and we &apos;re inspired , inspired and vereint .
in the last 50 years , we have the ocean fishing as we were beaten to the forest .
well , he mentioned some algae and some fischmehle , and then he said , hühnchen-pellets .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds for this place .
now last year , on this site of 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
now , i want to take this idea a little bit further from what a little bit crazy is .
the summary is a short set of übersicht and a symbol of the area that it comes from .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
so we went into &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot more .
so i moved this and did this other film on the big ship that will end .
and the level of excitement was huge . we had to build cameras and all sorts of things .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
i asked the top-wissenschaftler times : &quot; do we really need to go down near zero ? &quot;
it &apos;s all that food we eat , clothing , tv , heat .
in general , they don &apos;t have a miracle that you need to take a miracle to a certain date .
but in this case , we have to give vollgas and a miracle in very short time .
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that people put in here ?
and i decided that this is the one that i &apos;d like to share with the environment of the environment .
well , there are all kinds of spielereilösungen like this , but they &apos;re all not getting a lot of stuff .
let &apos;s first , first of all , look at fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
one is the energy density that makes these technologies dramatically smaller than kraftwerken .
instead of breaking the head , you just burn it . a great thing .
if countries are meetings in places like koppenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
klimaskeptiker : do you have one or two sentences to convince you ?
they talk about it , they &apos;re thinking about what it &apos;s going to look like , they rangeln .
and that is that bwl-studenten were trained to find a proper plan , ok !
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
if anybody would have built a 2,5cm high apparatus , he would have carried the price home .
and the basale lesson , i think , is actually a verbindender sport .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a collector .
it &apos;s because opportunities don &apos;t go back on this planet , they go forward .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t destroy simultaneously .
it &apos;s not happening in this country at all , but 160.000 times in the world last year .
it &apos;s absolutely cool , and it &apos;s seelentötend itself to us that can afford it .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this verrottete stuff , like maniok .
but that &apos;s not what it &apos;s all about , and then i open my hand .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me .
and people in the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen that right . &quot;
and then he added , really , quite emotional , that has ruined all the experience .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply to one another self .
and then you would ask , &quot; how happy are the moments of life in life ? &quot;
just to give you a sense of correlation that is correlation , correlation is about .5 .
some of you may be thinking , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
i &apos;ve calculated that it takes time to play at 21 billion hours a week .
oh , you know that . ok . ok , so we have some players here .
this is me , as i am in life , i &apos;m bad .
why is it impossible in games to think , you couldn &apos;t just achieve anything ?
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
the second wiki of the world , with almost 80,000 einträgen , is the world of warcraft .
we &apos;re working with universities all over sub-saharan africa , and they have a social redesign .
and he called this part of his kurses , the x factor , the potential of the human will .
we tap from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s feucht , it &apos;s very comfortable .
they &apos;re helfen nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
well , when i was a neuling on college , i had my first biologiekurse .
but at the time , as a mehrzelligen organisms , things began to change .
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
of course , this leads to some major complications -- rückenverletzungen , 30 percent of it -- chronic rückenverletzungen .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of humanity &apos;s secret .
they live in the deep of the kongolesischen , and they &apos;re just very hard to do it .
this could be the evolutionary origin of it , &quot; it puts it in the eggs . &quot;
i worked with people with zwergenwuchs -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one had anything .
now , mind , i want to sustain certain trennungen , anatomisch , in our culture .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been gezeugt at the beginning of the talk .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
feminism is about stereotypes about gender aufzulösen , which is why feminism is nothing female .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be impossible to be gelaunt , if you wear pants .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
our cities have been equipped in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
please look at the form of the iceberg , and where he is at the wasserlinie .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , was this guy .
they say that all things that are shown up there will follow a life cycle .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
and then he said three words -- the emotionslosesten words i &apos;ve ever heard .
because when the wine is , and the person is there , i open it .
while we were abstürzen , i had this feeling , human , to die is not terrifying .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by stuxnet .
so , for example , he would work as well -- in a power station or in a automobilfabrik .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand a brand .
how can we keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three fresh ones .
i think if you keep people from it , you &apos;ll get them closer to failure .
we have to encourage people not to have fear that they might be verängstigen .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide , and it explains the access .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
so i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite students , erntearbeiter breugel in the met .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion bildpunkte ? &quot;
and what only do you want to see when you want to see van gogh made this masterpiece ?
and this is a great konzeptionelles model of the world , so long they don &apos;t have a teilchenphysiker .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
so , if you &apos;re kind of thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a baugrundstück , and you &apos;re already considering this area for the second city .
one thing , as you already know , has been geklärt , there &apos;s a lot of mieter .
or even more of these cities to build , or hundreds of spread around the world ?
and after that , we looked at what the case people were more likely to paint .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it comes to our own best interests .
and if their employees cannot auseinanderhalten them , they can &apos;t do their customers . &quot;
now these decisions in the number of choices that make them a decision .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order of the decisions .
who could be predicted &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; nyan black &quot; ?
two strümpfe for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
in one , i was the classic asian student , the unerbittliche demands for itself .
and i was katapultiert from a puzzlestück to the next katapultiert , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
at the end of a county , i cook a giant topf soup that we shared .
but if i could give this , and it could be safe , i would do it .
we have developed an app for layar , augmented reality , to find that aeds .
but what you really do is to show what is possible with technology today .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami-sirenen work , but people steal the batteries .
if you know something about regierungstechnologie , you know it doesn &apos;t usually work that way .
but on &quot; citizens connect &quot; is all public , so everyone can see it .
if we want that institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice as granted .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the government .
the next steps , as the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosionsartigen curve .
and it makes it part of the methods that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
the poor were caught in indras chambers in indras chambers , in an old muffigen book .
this is how you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put online .

and she believed that these are the issues that we have to care about .
in socially weak and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .

but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
i talk about race and the question , if we have the right to kill .
and after terrorism , of course , the rassentrennung and decades of rassistisch , of course , motivierten and apartheid , of course .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t listen to him , it &apos;s not just a burglar .

most of the masseninhaftierungen in this country didn &apos;t really find in the classroom in the classroom in the classroom .
and the old saying , &quot; if it blutet , the demand &quot; is very true . &quot;

and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
i gave her the aspirin . i gave her medicine to take the heart from the heart .

i was ordnete to rehydrieren him and asked my colleagues as well .
and you know the leier of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa later .
ninety percent of our fangs were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason .

this plant contains some very strong tryptamine that the serotonin , dimethyltryptamin-5 , and methoxydimethyltryptamin , very much like .
you can only put in conjunction with some other chemicals that mao denaturieren .
so these are all flickr-bilder , and they &apos;re all standing in relation to each other in the relationship with each other .
the doctor says a has this benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this , a study of investing in volunteers in volunteers .
he makes a point of living in this now , and maybe things start to do slowly .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
we made small pieces , made a fehlerkorrektur and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
as we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the fehlerrate was a $ 10,000 base of a 10,000 base base .
think about that : we have a 4-buchstaben code : a , c , g and t.
the chromosome that was in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve put in .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that goes on the atmosphere .
we &apos;re going to take the first line to the limits of biological reality and to those of us .
and , if that &apos;s true -- and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
maybe we can &apos;t just auslöschen this out of 500 years of rational research in a vortrag talk .
it was lit up by the inside , and from below the bottom , and everything is erhellte through a göttliches fire .
and the westantarktis that showed up over a few unterwasserinseln is particularly strong .
around christmas , i went back to the tennessee , a billion tons of infection .

so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
would you like to cut down , kegelig , blah , blah , blah , and so on .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .

i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time to make our good decisions better .

we have three perfect vorstellbare physical objects that we can identify all of us in a three-dimensional world .
so we überlisten our brains , because our brains really simply don &apos;t make sense that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
so i would say there are three simple rules to follow , to try and achieve a realistisches outcome .
one of the most important things is that we have to think that government is not the same as politics .

this is what i &apos;m doing . he &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 feet in the width , 22 meters in diameter .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational design and people started to think that creativity was completely coming from their individual .
they caught the poem on his tail and put it back in their body and took it on the paper .
when i heard that , i thought it was creepy -- that &apos;s just what my creative process is doing . “ .
even i had work , or i had ideas that made out of a source through me , which i really don &apos;t know .
because you see that i do everything i have , i don &apos;t have any more than that .
but this doesn &apos;t push very strong enough of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .

gene-gun is , yes , like a kind of luftdruckpistole , which is sort of like this , two centimeters or something .
we &apos;re not going to answer it immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and this is happening right now .
and in this mind , you know , in this mind , abgerufen , and with these virtual images , the imagination , has been known as well .
maybe you can stand up for a second so that you can go and talk to the two about the project .
and that &apos;s what it meant to determine that i discover the outside world , so i &apos;m going to explore the real world .
not when i think locally organic and the neighbor thinks less organic , it doesn &apos;t work all the time .
and what does it really mean , of course , intuitively , and how do our channels work in the perception and how the cognitive process works ?

i think that the stream would have been enthusiastic if he had the klanglichen of modern modern klaviere .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , that has to do with this , that they deceive themselves .
here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention to the stabilisierung of our lebensverhältnisse .
we need this lie to this lie that we can &apos;t keep the deception , without that we can &apos;t live .
the person from the monkey abstammen , and , yes , there would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .

that &apos;s what &apos;s in small style , so you can also use your rasierer in your car for a little bit of wechselrichter .
but if you want to have several of these wechselrichtern , and you want to build a net , it becomes extremely complicated .
and to that purpose , people are always coming and looking at our versuchsstand , sort of like our inselteststand .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far there is a piece of the future .
because the music allows him to come up with his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and the creativity of his imagination .
they built this complicated set of channels , and they kept water out of the land , and out in the river .
well , i don &apos;t like that question , because it &apos;s the logic of our nahrungssystems for the last 50 years .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
my response to that was drawing and painting from aliens , alien worlds , robots , raumschiffen and all this .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was reached , a whole new world of creativity for filmschaffende .
that &apos;s how the circle between my existence was as science-fiction-fan as a child , as a child , and the score .
there were people who used to think we were really doing this ozeanwesen , and we &apos;ve been pandora on the planet .
the al gore book &quot; we have choice &quot; and david mckays &quot; sustainable energy cream . &quot;
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
and , although it really seems easy , it &apos;s actually really hard to work because people are pushing very fast .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
so , the performance of working with prototypes , but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
in the rich world , diseases that have millions of us only have threatened by a generation , hardly yet .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about immunization for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
but i was worried about this article , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it .
a few weeks ago , i told you a few weeks ago , and i believe i &apos;m a little bit of schrill .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s not .
everything we eat , every reiskorn , every branch , every branch , was changing by the people .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our text on greater food , better food food .
we can hinbewegen them where we want to hinbewegen them , and we will move them where we want .
a colored capsule , which is yellow and at the other red , is better than a white capsule .
perhaps too much time if you think about how many problems we have in the real world .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or zynisch .

we don &apos;t really have that , in real life , that feeling that a lot of employees are willing to stand .
there &apos;s also this epic story , these inspirational history , why we are and what we have to do .
you &apos;ve heard about &quot; level &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; or &quot; + 1 strength . &quot;
until today , the world of warcraft-spieler has spent millions of years trying to solve the virtual problems of azeroth .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one outcome . player are super-mächtige , hopeful individuals .
and the only problem is you believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
a man who opened the doors for me was my pediatrician at a.i. dupont institute in wilmington .
and we don &apos;t like our kids if we &apos;re giving them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
and of course , it &apos;s going to destroy the heart that conversely was told , you know , it &apos;s just enough .

we put our assumptions out to the outside , where , not surprisingly , he got more attention than mine .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another , until they reach their first million .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a verborgenes laughing that trees .
i think it &apos;s just like you , sometimes , just like you &apos;re playing alone , and we loten limitations of our inner and outer worlds .
and in the other case , the sperm carries an x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the eizelle .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to identify testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re going to take people &apos;s organs and put them in other people &apos;s organs .
i &apos;m politically progressiv , and i &apos;m verteidige people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it makes me nervous .
so they made this part , because they were part of a aufklärerischen system in which two things were common .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5-jährige should have the right to get to sex or to get married .
i told him , &quot; well , do you have a political asylum in consideration instead of having an operation to separate it ? &quot;
if you surrounded yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to appreciate it .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a spürenden part and a reagierendenteil .
now , look at what happened this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
all the kids from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
it could have a impulse to each individual , which comes from people , from the movements of people or something .
so the idea is that we actually engage people with them in which they do things together .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top , you can go to the top of london &apos;s new berggipfel .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated from nature and that everything is connected .
it starts with the interactions , then the schimpfwörter , then , the bush-verleumdungen and the final people are actually doing art .
my circle started at the high school in stow , ohio , ohio , where i was the klassenschwuchtel .
and i should say that i have bauspeicheldrüsenkrebs , and i want you to please please . &quot;
as i was thinking about it later , a saying that , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
the nutzdaten are going to go to the gray box , beschädigen the centrifuge and the iranian kernenergie-programm , verzögert -- assignment .
stuxnet just like a laborratte , which doesn &apos;t like our cheese -- schnüffelte , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
and after we had a different kind of genius , i went to see that this is an assault attack .
so , in large and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywoodfilmen , where the überwachungskamera is fed the überwachungskamera with the vorher videoaufnahmen .
and every time i get somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
a lot of spaßiger negotiations and stories that i can tell you about 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click it now .
i think , finally , to me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
i mean , i hope that we are just going to be with this digital medium of art , and they represent it online .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics around the small , tiny particles .
so , imagine if you were at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth building it .
i &apos;ve been trying to figure out how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they are .
this is a picture of a large , new urban , which is built in south korea as the center of north korea .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that people offered something between two to 59 different fund .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of the entscheidungsüberlastung , it &apos;s the konkretisierung .
the other half of the clients are about the low , four gears , to the 56 autofarben , many possibilities .
there was a meeting to the reconciliation and a calm voice , and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
she reminded me that i was now as old as she was climbing the boat .
and even though i graduated from my degree , i realized i couldn &apos;t deal with a career in law .
she grew up at a time when the social norm and the local passion was brought to the most important person .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
so for me , photography seemed to be more about being the right place at the right time .
and yes , i even have the house up on the island of red to make it look swiss .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
make the techniques that are easy to use and start to embrace patients in the team .
and then decided to go and use seattle the app to use to get the citizens to clean up the verstopften .
it was about a way to find out the parents who are the right public schools for their children .
and as many people , i thought it was mainly about choosing people in office .
they don &apos;t fight that fight that we all fight , which is , who can talk ; they all be allowed to talk .
either it will be a classic s-kurve , like this , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
in any way that we don &apos;t really understand yet , this is what the ability to do , the ability to niederzuschreiben information .
if i was in fact a egoist , i would have written it on a virus and put it into the room .
this communication now allowed the case of communities to be in a sense of the same boat ; they were synergetisch .
let &apos;s say , i want to make numbers , which is a simple example that i &apos;ve been using for this .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever have written from hand .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single murmel .
we &apos;ve all heard of feen and nymphen , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
and sometimes , when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and strength that otherwise doesn &apos;t have it .
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise . &quot;
the united states of america is the only country in the world , dreizehnjährige children &apos;s death in jail .
in south africa , people understood that the rassentrennung is not going to be overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are affected as well .
that we need to combine our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity , with humanity , compassion and justice .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i launched a new university , called &quot; singularity university . &quot;
but then the technology was developed , and then the technology was so cheap , so that we could use it with our wegwerf-mentalität .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re living on a planet with 5.000-mal more energy than we use a year .
they live in a world that has information and communication in their abundance , how nobody could have predicted .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard about .
imagine if you have a blinddarmentzündung and you &apos;re going to be a überwiesen , and you &apos;re going to überwiesen your durchschnittsleistung , which is about 400 percent in terms of blinddarmentzündungen .
other medical scientists fear that , but the notfallmedizin is particularly , because we see the patients just so fleeting .
if i was in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
and this was an example , which is the way our own governments , the technology , against us .
the first betonblocksteine were made , 1868 and entstammten of a simple idea : augmented from cement with festgelegten measurements that fit .
it &apos;s been estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
lego basically has the betonbaustein , the building block , and it made a building block for our imagination .
as the betonblock , the transistor allows us to build much more complex , more complex cycles , a rock after another .
instead of doing that , you know , you &apos;ve got to code , you know , , you have to be programming , or löten , littlebits , allows them to program with simple , intuitive gestures .
i grew up in the forests of britisch columbia , and i believed that these forests are there to become gerodet .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time saying that we &apos;re going to be contributing to this area .
and the answer is : you &apos;ll expect to call the doctor the next morning , and ask a change for the prescription .
wherever we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle is a question of choice .
oppertunitätskosten lower happiness that we get through our choices , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is amazing .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that is actually able to build your hardware in a biological system .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , that digital information is really accurate .
triplets of these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids ; and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so , people think about evolution as a gene that has changed a lot from biology .
and it &apos;s just nurmale selection . we can go to lebensfähigkeit , production of chemicals or treibstoffproduktion and so on .
but to be fair -- the group of chemists don &apos;t receive the reputation of alkoholsüchtigen manisch-depressive people .
by socrates , he believed that he believed he would have a dämon that he made out of further distance .
in those opportunities , the poem came in complete and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
he just looked in the sky and he said , „ sorry , can &apos;t you see that i &apos;m driving car ? “ .
more importantly , are physically , which is why you can only move them through your hands and access your hands .
so , i think we &apos;re in the same way as a step further than the world &apos;s academic world .
he then turned this helmet to this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum that &apos;s gone .
now we think our love to stories depends on that we sat on our parents &apos; lap .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce , the real world .
ah , what you see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see .
so a lot of natural , in a tank , but i &apos;m sort of looking at where is salt and pepper .
and at the left-hand left , they can access to me , and then i hope that there is no sugar in there .
i &apos;ll get the whole overview of the whole überblick now , and can now say , can show me all the things with chocolate .
they spend every day , they give them about two grams of phosphorus , and every day they have to limit two grams of phosphorus .
and when i went to dinner and say yes , there &apos;s a pill with offenbach-geschmack and a glass of water .
if you take these windel , you zerkleinern , you zerkleinern , sterilisieren and the powder to plant trees .
today i want to share with you what else i &apos;m simulation , which is , again , in a verbal language .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that a orchestra has declined from then as a unspielbar .

so if the transporttechnologie transporttechnologie would be as fast as the mikroprozessor-technologie advances , then we could go into a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
that was never before in the history of technologie-entwicklung , this sort of rekursivem growth , which is the scale of all the few years exponentially .
in fact , the tröpfchen , which had been growing one for growth , faster than others , and integrated more and more chemicals from the outside and shared more chemicals .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in the traditional sense .
of course , the chance of randomly elected instructions is very small that by chance , by chance , numbers , you know , are just going to make numbers , so you don &apos;t know the instructions .
there is , &quot; this airplane is made out of hunderttausenden kleinteilen , which work together to make their flight safer . &quot; don &apos;t you mind that ? &quot;
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; bryan , do you feel my hug ? &quot;

but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pein if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence from you .
i think that the molecular biology in general now , in general , is speaking , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
so , as crazy as that , of course , in the context of my talk , we might be able to move physically into not existenten , virtual worlds , for the model of the holodecks .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself why all the designers are going on with so natural , archaischen urformen of communication , interaction and so on .
so if we look at the development of our society , there &apos;s a moment of view , then we &apos;re moving from the third to the fourth gesellschaftsgeneration , or gesellschaftsform .
that means , from the local village , actually , a global village has been with the same principles , of course , largely intuitive , but also the total transparency .

we had to do that at that time . when we read a book , we took the description of the autors and projected them on the screen screen in our heads .
and there was something interesting about this , which is what jacques cousteaus shows me , was the idea of what was the idea of one of us on earth itself .
anyway , by the part that &apos;s going to do with curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working for years , sometimes we were two to three months on sea .
so , again , i had a little team on unbekanntem terrain terrain , and we made &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that wasn &apos;t there before .

if you go to this path , where you believe and magic , and the magic , and science , you can get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .

they don &apos;t belong , because he was a reminder of memory , the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he could keep .
and in that way , time is actually the critical variable , which is a erinnerndes self from a erlebenden self . time has very little influence on this story .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re doing a holiday that &apos;s very often the case , that means we &apos;re mostly doing vacation in the service of the erinnernden themselves .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and it really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives and vice versa .

if you &apos;re also playing , you see a couple of nuances here , which is the oben eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , why we &apos;re better in play than in real life .
we trust that someone will spend time with us that the rules are going to be eingehalten , that we have the same goal , and to the end up .
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
and imagine that i &apos;ve even had a child &apos;s child with dr. p. , and i &apos;m trying to stop this practice , natürllich without success .
they &apos;ve just been told that they were the einser-schüler and that they &apos;re the students with the note enough , and they have taught them something , and they &apos;re treating them .
and as we speak about bacteria , you know , that each of us is aware of our gut in the rest of our bodies in the rest of our bodies ?
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that is not just natural , but led and decided to make us as a individuen. in the choices that we do .
play is a formwandler , and it can take a lot of shapes , some of which some of you have calm down , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , erstaunen .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us work , and interact . and the unexpected verknüpfungen that we form are the real nährboden of creativity .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in 1979 , in the same day , in exactly the same moment , every single one baby -- okay .
what she was doing was a anatomisches concept , and they were replacing it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
now , as you all remember , our founding founding the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was in the bottom of a very strange concept of anatomy .

i love to find a different way of finding a different kind of outfit , insane outfit , and recently photograph and photograph .
now , this is just one example of how we feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do a few years ago .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve been programming , we went to the strandpromenade in venice , my kids were involved , and we created this .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from the night of this teacher , woman post , who said , &quot; i have to see it .
now , when it comes to us , the systems that are controlling the systems and the valves control , then we can actually create a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
and i called them up , and i called her knowledge to compare her expertise with what we found in the code and in the data .
and if you manipulated the speed of this rotors , you actually get able to crack the rotor and then even blow the centrifuge .
so the idea is to show that brands are part of life , actually , to bring it to the film ?
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that has a negative konnotation -- but you know how that will evolve ?
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth it , some really familiar brands .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that these category really makes a positive thing , in contrast to &quot; struggle smell and moisture . &quot;
well , there &apos;s verspielte tokens and achtsame tokens , these things that come and go , but a verspielte , achtsame brand is a pretty strong thing .
that means that every atom in the same time is at two different places , which is that the whole piece of metal is two different places .
but you could go to a completely new place , building a whole new block , the laws there would support such a building and don &apos;t give it a profit .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even kids who are trying to find their parents , which they have , in some cases , since a decade .
so what is it for an idea to insist that every family has a choice between a number of cities that are in competition for new residents ?
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read you and then i ask you to clap , if you &apos;re ready to take gary &apos;s &apos;s supply .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not on the top of the radweg , but there &apos;s a lot of disability that can &apos;t drive a decent job .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re barely hitting the media of today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
i put it together with my former preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because using the camera , the camera was in planning .
we were told later that if it was about the normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would have taken over two million dollars .
when i was a child , there was the future somewhere in 2000 and the people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then there &apos;s a pretty good picture of how they do it .
so we take something very complicated , it turns into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
and it connects all of us together to something that is much bigger , and also able to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
i know and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because you come from a series of hunderttausenden programs that have done the job .
we bring our kids closer and closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
she took me out , and she said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t have it . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who &apos;s a year older and a year younger sister .
as it would feel to live in a world where german state people would hinrichten people , especially if they were a lot of jews .
then a woman suggested to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you must be very , very tapfer . &quot;
and every year , we ask the students to create the products , the products , and the services that are positive in a decade that can affect billions of people .
and then their pupils are expanding , they &apos;ve come down in front of the head , look down and eat hard , and start telling their stories .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
we want the world of creator , the inventor , the mitwirkenden , because this world we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
now there are some of us who are kind of forgotten that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; really , the different possibilities of being .
this is a people who are not cognitively different between the colors of blue and green , because the himmelszelt of the forest is dependent on the forest .
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 varieties of ayahuasca , which you all recognize in the big distance in the forest that seems to be a kind of like this .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the kongressbibliothek and it &apos;s in a field of 300 megapixeln .
and this is something that &apos;s using the complexity that people use , and it &apos;s always going to use for the user with the application .
if people have freedom , each of us is for themselves to do things that maximize our common lives and no one has to decide for us .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you and not good grade in my class .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of salt chemical and put into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code , and made viral particles .
and i argued that we might be a new form of kambrischen explosion in which there could be massive new artenbildung based on this digital design .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to get the fact that we reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
and what &apos;s going on with the creative enterprise , that they make us insecure about the gegenseitigen of human rights -- in a way that other people don &apos;t do ?
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s a distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that &apos;s going to protect you from the consequences of your work .
it &apos;s kind of a very sad thing to do , because it &apos;s not that much , because it doesn &apos;t actually seem like what you actually did , and what &apos;s actually going on .
another thing from the u.s. , which has also been to do with this vaterschaftstestgeschichte , it &apos;s the p.c.r , which is the polymerase-kettenreaktion , complicated word .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s going to be clear .
and if you want to be able to make a good choice in society in society , and you want to join , you need to have access to knowledge and technology .
and this is the kind of wealth that makes the virtual reality of the reality that people have in the vorindustriellen times , because they didn &apos;t need anything .
and as you can see , this is a very inselreiches area , and you had to navigate , from island to island to get food .
that means , instead of remembering us , we have standardized , far , strong , divided patterns of memories that we can hang our personal memories .
it &apos;s a direct ad , and not for the company for the company , for cybercriminals , but for the fact that they are helping this company to make these products successful .
it was on a klavierkursus for musikstudenten at my beloved old teachers , professor jürgen ude , a well-known beethoven-spezialist , konzertpianist and langjähriger professor of musikhochschule here in stuttgart .

this verweis that , in the core of the bub , knew that he was actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that .
and if you have this premise of eyes , you understand the logic that we &apos;re experiencing happiness through a lie of our world .
this looks something like who doesn &apos;t have any willensfreiheit , can &apos;t be made for his actions and claims , and he &apos;s therefore unzurechnungsfähig .
and yes , a lot of what &apos;s been said today , i &apos;m very , very much , because many , many beautiful statements that i &apos;ve been through .
as big as it would have to be a battery , so you have to have an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn the powder off .
that our system also has a preisanstieg , because we &apos;re doing another 20 percent with diesel , and also a preissteigerung on the other things .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years .
we came to the theme of music , and a few days later , i got an email , and that &apos;s where nathaniel was interested in geigenunterricht for me .
now , after i chose the government , i know that the wikipediakategorien , i know , that the most wikipediakategorien , the most wikipediakategorien , &quot; people of the year . &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you only look in looking at websites in this way , and look at all the way through the same way .
but the messlatte brought back very well . and people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t able to be able to do that .
and it made me consciously aware that you could use this roboterhafte , and you could use that kind of thing , and your consciousness in the vehicle , it can spell into this other form of existence .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but now i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to have a director , you know , a director , a leader , like a schiffskapitän or something .
now , the exact connection between a co2-anstieg and der temperaturveränderung and where they are left , there are some people , but not very much .
the terrapower-konzept means that instead of part of the part of that one percent , one percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
we should use the effektivitätsmaßnahmen to take reduction on the way , the less we are going to be less and less , and the more likely to be the temperature .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can befüllen it for 60 years -- think of a column -- that they bury without all the complexities .
bill , i think of almost all humans here , when i say , i really hope that their wish is true . thank you very much .
the average for most of you is about 50cm , bwl-studenten that half of the lawyers , but not much , aren &apos;t much better than adults .
drinking water , urbares land , rainforests , gas , gas : they disappear , and that &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of chaos from that chaos , we &apos;re also disappearing .
well , what i hear all the time is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monokultur , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing that is wrong .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be more time to understand what that means .
how to raise happiness is very different from how you think and think if you think about yourself , or whether you think about yourself .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people that we like people , after we &apos;ve done it with them , even when they defeated us .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of ancient greek historikers , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
so we are not just responsible for the people we love to preserve before schicksalsschlägen , but they &apos;re also prepared to get good .
you have to separate two things : one of the medical fact to be a medical fact , and to the other point of opinion about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
but it &apos;s also a secret to our future , a future where we need to adapt to increasing challenges , through greater creativity and druch verstärkte .
so gender is really complicated , not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed across the range of bandwidth .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
and since she &apos;s not heard of me as the woman who &apos;s running here at ted in her underwear -- that &apos;s what i found a couple of things .
we found one for them , we took them , and we took care of them , and we gave them eight , because it was necessary , because it was necessary .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most complicated part of the windows- , and it was made by unzähligen day- .
and if you &apos;ve already heard that the dropper of stuxnet complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the nutzdaten are a science for itself .
and i spent 30 days doing nothing than this -- spaßig at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
what i want to do is a film around product placement , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every werbeagentur that we talked about , their customers , the fingers of that .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms that are made the piece of metal still there and move at the same time , and move the same atoms .
so if a single atom can be at the same time at two different places , that piece of metal can be in two different places , why don &apos;t you ?
i loved it to this business , but at a time i asked myself , you know , you know , you never know anything ?
it also makes me excited about the great product that i &apos;m zusammenstelle , and so i &apos;m willing to make myself be interested in this .
it &apos;s not a particularly scientific story -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee , or tea , and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how ? &quot;
and you could be able to connect them with government services , if these needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like several other , which we find in our field , is a kind of gerade curve .
telefonie , computers , videobänder , cd-roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and then she said , &quot; next to me , that you &apos;ll always do the right thing to do . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing .
it was very quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we can ever kill ourselves for the systematic of people .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the staff and 1.3 percent of the public health .

and when i took her chest with the stethoskope abhörte , i could hear a knackendes sound on both sides that told me that she was suffering from heart failure .
and then on a day of a day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke out and i might be able to feel better again .
and i went back through the same kind of tortur of shame and self-doubt , felt free , and went back to work until it comes back and again and again .
oh , you go to a cocktail party and you like to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
and then i take the same patient with brustschmerz , make it verschwitzt and geschwätzig and give it a little breath and give it a little breath , and suddenly the story is durchsetzt with contempt .
the u.s. intelligence agency two months ago , two months ago , the swiss accounts of mr. jain jain here , and on this gathering were 14,9 million dollars when it was frozen .
well , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this plant here .
the sioux-indianer didn &apos;t have to be less on sioux than the bow and arrow of tasks , when the americans stopped being americans when the horse stopped and pferdewagen tasks .
and even though they &apos;re all turned away , every minute we &apos;re asking our child &apos;s child , we ask ourselves , &quot; should i accept this call ?
the reason why i felt worse was with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans were , went up .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
we find all kinds of species here that have taken a second chromosome or a third of irgendwoher , each time thousands of characteristics in one second to a species .
they &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we &apos;re always a year back , and they have a dollar to do the right vaccine .
we &apos;re going to turn it forward , and we &apos;ll expect the first data to be able to collect in june or july , and take our journey to what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , on a kind of stir of these accidents , again , the debate about the value of science and science on such borders , it &apos;s easy to reject it .
because it makes a lot of sense as much as anything that i &apos;ve heard of , if it was , the absolutely crazy machende of the creative process .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me he was going to a schnellstraße day in los angeles , and there was everything for him .
in this case , we have three siftables as farbtöpfe , and i can use it to cast color color in the middle , where they &apos;re then mixed .
you charge d.n.a on goldpartikel and the goldpartikel then , and then i put it on the luftdruckpistole , and then i &apos;ve got the lights up to the zwiebeln so that it &apos;s like that .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re going to have a similar spread , and then we &apos;re also very similar to the extent that there are more people who can be involved .
the second thing is that since since this archaischen models , we &apos;ve been able to be able to speak very , very , very sensitive , even though we &apos;re using a kodifizierte language .
but for me , in the realm of interactive media , as particularly impressive , that we have verankert by se in our biological memory , the ability to think .
so you have to deal with what &apos;s called , because it &apos;s not just changing it , that it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this , is not , you know , gray , but here in this rosanen crowd , it &apos;s just happening .

i was nervte my father until finally he had a tauchschule in buffalo , new york , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
and it worked . again , we created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money on the movie .
so i started a company , with my good friend stan winston winston , who was at the time of the best make-up- and creature-designer . she was called digital domain .

you know jerry bruckheimer-filme , where there is the &quot; dream-team . &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientist , the ex-sträfling and only together you can save the world .
when i &apos;m in the next decade , i &apos;m sure about two things : that we can create any future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
i would be so umschreiben : not the most powerful of his kind , and not the intelligenteste of his species , but the one that can adapt to change .
there are the usual . the typical one . but not the normal , and you would want to learn these poor , gray person , if they really existed ?
it seems like we &apos;re quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but in fact , the largest part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite the same .

and so i think of myself as one of the most experimental ones , with most other experimental quantenphysikern , who need a good share of the complex ideas together .
in that we gave him a little push , we could veranlassen it at the same time and not digitize it -- something which is only allowed in quantum mechanics .
the director of congress came to the stage , and she said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you for your talk , but maybe we may look at the tedtalk .

and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open up all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is abhaut ? &quot;
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of government , in a way that can actually achieve something that can be done by society .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , taxes pay for taxes and perform services .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transporttechnologie , then it would be a very unvernünftig scale , which is a flat line in a flat line .
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of mine , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
we think because you &apos;ve taught us that that the real question is , is this a human being deserves to die for a crime of crime ?

and after a very brief period of time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and konvertierte completely in a new species based on the new software that we have in the cell .
we now have , from our discoveries around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the designkomponenten of the future .
we are verbessern from human beings to better people , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you .
so it &apos;s at the same time . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the greatest scientific experiment that has ever been addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .

one of the areas that we see that we &apos;re seeing in our culture today in our culture today , in the united states , are the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .

so i came up with a need , just a check , and instead i asked a check from which i didn &apos;t have the slightest idea of how i was supposed to be .
so , the wake of my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
and i started by doing science , scientific literature , like this zentrifugen in natanz , and found that they &apos;re strukturiert in what &apos;s called a strukturiert , and each kaskade is 164 zentrifugen .
i have a check in my pocket , in my pocket bag , on the oberorganisation of the ted-organisation , the sapling-stiftung -- a check in the base of $ 7100 to fund my ted-auftritt in the next year .

and if you give people the people who are eating it , if you say that , that would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re not going to be there and hostile .
at this point , and when you laugh , you see how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience something , what artists can tell us very well .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , that the courage to practice .
i &apos;m grateful with the premium-kola-mensch that he &apos;s got the word again again , because after the mauerfall , you couldn &apos;t use the word anymore , because all the left was bad .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to grow up in the ocean , so far out in the sea that you don &apos;t verschmutzt the environment . &quot;
some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on insurance because one might be lazy , so you &apos;ll eat , because you know , you know , one is going to save the oil .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can do it in denial , and people like jenny can walk around and botschaften and botschaften messages from plattformen and larry and larry king .
but i think in this frame here and with purpose , from a deception to a deception , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle there and go from the stage .
from the point of view , if you have a holiday , and the second week is exactly as good as the first one , the zweiwöchige vacation is twice as good as the einwöchige holiday .

today , we can for the first time -- and the campaign obama &apos;s campaign has shown this -- we can get from the digital world to the physical forces of networks to the physical world .

and i just want to talk to him again , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
but if we can do it &apos;s an effective windows-virus on a laptop that &apos;s used by a wartungsingenieur to konfigurieren this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world in a tedtalk , and i knew that i was going to do something a little different .
18 months ago , i did something different with google , and i was doing something about the museums and art . my favorite thing is that today , my green light , there was my green light .
i mean , it can sound strange about that , that one thing at the same time is two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are really quanten objects that are in a small room together .
we &apos;ve added six different flavors , or 24 different flavors , and we have two different flavors , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first of all , i think , what would be more people ?
i had to make sure that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to zerdrücken us , but it was coming down .
every dollar has been held , and it was held in more education for english and mathematics , whatever we had to do for it . mostly the new things that came out of the second hand .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to get them to play some kind of play , to control their health better .
so they either survived together , or they went together . that meant that a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were more often repeated and matched by evolution .
it &apos;s this kopf-herz-verbindung that i think is driving us , not just to be open to all the bright and begeisternden things , but also for the dark and problematischen .
there &apos;s no distinction to make technology and design that allows us to be human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears , ausgrenzung and injustice .
so these are just some of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but the last six days , or the last six years .
they use resources like the staatstrojaner to bespielen their computer with a trojaner that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their online-diskussionen , their passwörter , to collect their passwörter .
here &apos;s a picture i took at the northern end of the baffin-inseln , when i went to the narwhal-jagd , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather &apos;s .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant goals of earth , realizing that they &apos;re not removed .
they represent parts of the human imagination in recent times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , the dreams of our children , how the dreams of our own children are part of geography .
and of course , byproduct of all this is the immense rich virtual models of any kind of interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just überflüge or photographs and so on , but by collective storage .
and then they go to the verbraucher-elektronik store to zusammenzustellen a stereo -- speaker , cd-player , a kassetten-player , radio , verstärker . and in this one electronics , there are so many stereo plants .
work -- we are blessed , as carl pointed out , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every single day on the planet -- until the randolph hotel .
it &apos;s a picture of the first strahlenpartikels that the entire track of the lhc zurücklegte , then absichtlich with a part of the lhc to prasseln a rain of particles on the detector .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to be about to write from the world as the work that &apos;s going on after the abgefahrenen success of my last book , right ?
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like the following . in front of centuries , you know , centuries ago , in the deserts of the desert , people were nordafrikas into the deserts of saint tänzen and music for hours .
an interesting consequence of interactions that we started to see was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like the color of the light , how to do it with liquids .
i &apos;m in conclusion , and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the bachelorarbeit of michael burk , ann-kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan-moritz müller .
but there &apos;s also a symbolic function , why is there a little bit of a täschchen , where there is no such thing as a little bit of money , so that there &apos;s no such thing as if it &apos;s not that practical ?
when we go back to the software , here the first line of interfaces , the first line of interfaces that were very abstract , where you took months to deal with these systems .
not to burn a little bit better than a little bit better , and put it in the verbrennungsanlage and to lose all the materials for cycles , but first of all , how do you make cycles ?

the nice thing about this is that , in this island , you can basically do everything that we &apos;re going to get on this island of problems that we &apos;re going to get when we &apos;re going to increase our percentage of renewables .
i have to mention that nathaniel is a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electricity and thorazin , and handschellen , a trauma that has been following his whole life .
and in exactly the same way , nathaniel , nathaniel , when we started with our first lectures in walt disney hall , he had this kind of funny flackern in his eyes , and he was completely lost in his eyes .
and like a miracle , he took his violin and began to play a few little bits of violinkonzerten , and then asked me to play , you know , spielen , tschaikowski , sibelius , sibelius .
as soon as it &apos;s finished , if it &apos;s going to be like that , it &apos;s all clearly clear , because the wirtschaftlichkeit , the energy density is so different as we know them .
unless , you know , you &apos;re very short in front , and you &apos;re funding only the learning . i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
it requires us to do all of our senses on the task , and that we think our thinking about how our emotions and our do , in the challenge that we are facing .
but if you give the shape you give the placebo , for example , change into a smaller pill , and that blue color , and you see a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
so , i &apos;m going to suggest to you , if you &apos;re quick , you &apos;re going to look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first heiklen part here .
that &apos;s true for laien , thinking about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are as mess as everyone else .
imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the urlaubs , all of your images are being annihilated and you get a amnestisches drug , so you can &apos;t remember anything .
everybody who &apos;s not going to be different from these terms of happiness , and i &apos;m involved in a lot of researchers that have been vermasselt for happiness for the long term of happiness that has been vermasselt in the same way .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in climate .
and they would be so eager to go into the würfelspiel , because games are so intriguing and uns , glückseliger productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
well , i hope that you agree with me that gamers are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability i had to take apart is that the world is always meant to describe me with these definitions .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being ganzheitlich , and not all of its forces and possibilities , we can create in addition to the natural fight that you may have to have , a more disease .
and maybe that change could happen , because i &apos;ve seen so many people who have opened my doors , rather than to meet people who were constrained by me or i wanted to see an idea .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i like booster rockets to go to the next stage of the orbit in the next level of the orbit to go into the ocean .
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science that allows the change to allow the change to prevent disease , could also enable us to adopt super-attribute , hyper-kapazitäten -- the better memory .
they &apos;re not other than anything that they do in the morning and gives them extra strength and that will increase their pace and will help them keep their balance .
so if i look in this room and see people who have already reached a beachtenswerten success , or they have been there , i want to offer this memory : wait .
it &apos;s meant to say that there could be something , on average , on average , what women &apos;s brains are doing for male social relationships , and aufmerksamer for the schutzbedürftige .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we &apos;re designing .
and this is an exhibition -- and that includes all the circle -- that it &apos;s april , this april , in the middle of los angeles in downtown los angeles , called &quot; style of the streets . &quot;
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had something to do with augenerfassungstechnologie , but i &apos;ve just got a little bit of erfasst , and i &apos;ve been able to put some of them around with the legs .
so when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
and if you play with your particles , all kinds of weird things -- like you &apos;re walking straight through walls , or you can be at the same time at two different places .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras , which meant that we have to do this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way our country &apos;s gone .
the fact is that you &apos;re looking at the first time , the first time you had more information than the second time , but i would dare to think that it was a second time in real life .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , about helping us to behave like knotenpunkte to behave in the world around the world .
but more importantly , that app is that you represent a new generation that the problem of government is -- not as the problem of a verknöcherten institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you have to just build the systems .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically grunzende notes of me , hoping to make a similar idea in your head , which is a kind of similarity with my original idea .
i live living from building computers , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism i &apos;m using to build computers , couldn &apos;t use the recent progress in computation .
ladies and gentlemen , what i have vast trust in our future is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to provide the great challenges of our planet .
and at the end of the day i grabbed my things , bpa the hospital and went to the parking car to drive home when i did something else i didn &apos;t do .
and there was another nurse , and he didn &apos;t tell the sister that had seen the wife after the wife , but another three words to me fear , and those three words that i know .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues that a orthopäde in my hospital would have lost the wrong leg , you know , i think i would have trouble to look at it .
a few weeks ago , we brought up to risd and gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; what . &quot;
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the character , nothing found the business business of devil , they were killing the five missionare of the devil .
you know , we really -- moderate goals like the ersatz of the whole petrochemischen industry industry . right ? if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else ?
my father , for example , was chemists and i can &apos;t remember in his 40 years as a chemist that he was asked to be afraid he was afraid to be chemist .
it was as if the time was stillstehen and the dancer through a kind of pforte , and he didn &apos;t do anything else than he ever did before -- but all they added together .
if an artist in spain did something that was a bit of a magical thing : „ allah , olé , olé , allah , großartig , great bravo , unfassbar , unfassbar unfassbar , there is : a flüchtiger look at god .
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic eiskappe , which had the size of the lower 48 years , had reduced 40 percent to 40 percent .
and if these tools are being created and a conscious awareness of their movements , each other will recognize and see the intricacies of our umgangs with them , then we can start with the study of new and entertaining interaktionsarten .
so i put it in front of the whole thing that i &apos;d like to do on german , because if i had to translate it into english again , it would be equivalent to me for translation of translation .
now , the notes all the other than a precise record of the composer is , but only a framework , i &apos;m now going to turn a framework , turning it back to the point of purpose and meaning .
it &apos;s not too late to begin to figure out if you can &apos;t do it , or learn how to do these little muscles that the vocal vocal chords are using right .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in addition to this , the talk of premium kola , that you can be a collective , and use solar energy , a little bit together .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a unreinheiten , he &apos;s enormous , because the water that comes through this farm comes out of the river .
businesses that are not worlds for themselves , businesses that are wiederherstellen , instead of aufzubrauchen , businesses , the extensiv , rather than only intensive , farmers who are not only done , but experts for relationships .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites -- and we bring these zoom-technologie to every single website like this .
and then , in fact , we created six months later , in which i was in a russian tauchboot wiederfand , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic through a bullauge .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside the fensters .
klimaverschlechterung means that their communities are not growing over many years , and it &apos;s too much rain , and too little rain , things will change as much as their environment can &apos;t sustain .
the kohlerevolution of industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , had a rapid event in the elektrizitätspreis and therefore we have refrigerators , air , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
to understand that right , which means to build deep in the ground almost like a vertical column , dieses urans , and then the process starts weiter , and then the process starts moving down ?
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries built this , therefore , that &apos;s why it &apos;s a quick reactor for our first .
and finally , shortly before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow , and you put it carefully on the top , step one step back , and &quot; ta-da &quot; ! you admire your work .
but then , almost always happens , it happens , that the &quot; ta-da &quot; is going to be a &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallows is that the whole thing will bend and einstürzt .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we &apos;re really doing .

we set up a website and asked a menschenmasse , &quot; if you see a aed , please join us where he is , &quot; when he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , of course .
we set out teams around the world , to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with artificial intelligence , you can test reinhusten or your blutwerte .

it should be our goal that if families think about where they &apos;re going to live and work , they give them the opportunity to choose between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competition for new residents .

some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from penicillin and have that information together with other bacteria into dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate with each other .

this was a riesen-aufschrei , because of course , the living language began to manifestieren in the form of writing , which is what fluid and life is , and let me go and do it in stone and so do it .
and when , of course , it &apos;s an intuitive thing , and as i can do as a designer , and as a creator , the things that are going to be designed to make things like this , they &apos;re very intuitive , because they &apos;re kind of intuitiv , because they &apos;re just doing fun .
but i have to understand in the core , in the nature , understand when information becomes information , when information comes from information information and information , so i know how i can make things more intuitive or less intuitive .
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of these are regierungsbeamte . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss .
and , if i take a step back , and look at everything , i can reinvent my course , maybe after my such-vergangenheit , and here , i looked for &apos; nepotistisch , or here , after bing , or here after live labs .

the main reason for this is that we might be enjoying this enormous shelves of mayonaise , mustard , burning and marmelade , and we don &apos;t actually see the comparison and the limitations , and then we can actually choose something out of the amazing exercise .
and we know that it &apos;s just not making sense to try to take 30 or 50 years into the future because everything will be so different that a simple hochrechnung of what we &apos;re doing right now is not making sense .

because i believe that the interactive media in us is archaische , cognitive models , , so paradigm , which in our biological memory has been very , very long time ago , and that we can actually create the only way through interactive media .
and so i get a very different view of the city , a very different impression , and i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get this kind of a different , virtual map of a very real city .

well , what this thing is doing is that it abfängt values of sensors -- like , for example , drucksensoren and vibrationssensoren code -- and it provides code code that &apos;s still während data , runs data .

we took a ps3-kamera , you have auseinandergebaut , you put it on a led-licht , and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we can build the code free to download the software for free .
as i said , i &apos;ve been going into some pretty awful situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , couldn &apos;t help me do anything so hard , and so dangerous as with these guys in a room .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how all of rna started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story of that that is that at that time , little öltröpfchen herumschwebten , which is different types of chemicals for chemicals .
and it gets better , the things that you and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , hd-video and a picture , libraries of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics -- are going to be literally entmaterialisiert and cheaper in your cell phone .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by using the use of tricoders , and they &apos;re getting better trained by the khan-akademie , and by using the opportunity to use 3d printers , and so much more productive and more productive than ever before .
whenever we think about native and landscape , we &apos;re either rousseau and the old gerücht of the fine wild , which is a rassistischer thought , or andererseits , and saying , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
we believe that polemik -- we believe that polemik is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website is 35 million hits every month .
but this is my prototype , but it looked pretty annoying , so on a branch , that thing on a branch , electronics on it and pressure and pressure , but that was the pressure was too high .
and this is the sound and the rhythm , which shows the topography of a region of a region and it has , of course , that you could defragmentieren these songs and put it together , and then go back to the left , and go back to the left .
and then the next , the next thing , which has been with &apos; 36 , or mental model , like the software model , they &apos;ve been working on what was going on , you know , the metaphor of a desktop , the metaphor of a desktop , to harness the computer .
and if i take one step further into this natural user user interface , where i &apos;m by voice , by speech , by language , by definition , by the gesture and not , you know , you have to drive things , and i &apos;m even more able to drive .

and have wind and the sun and the load of durchsimuliert and came to the conclusion , a very interesting outcome that you think about the conventional system that takes about 20 cents a kilowattstunde , which is going to take about 50 cents a kilowattstunde .
they summieren the ausgestoßene co2 , which leads to the temperaturerhöhung , and this has a few very negative consequences . effects on the weather and maybe worse , the indirekte consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the natural changes and the whole systems .
what you have to do is you might just seem to , but that &apos;s not it . you have to do all that co2 that comes from burning from the schornstein , catching up under pressure , and then we hope that it stays there .
it also has three great problems . the cost of , especially in hochregulierten countries , the question of security , is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human being , that the fuel cannot be used for weapons .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i could choose that wish , or i could choose that wish , which is that i could take that wish , halbierter energiepreis without co2 .
because at the moment , where i put my hand from you , so you &apos;re looking at it from the back , you know , this finger , my zeigefinger , you know , just where he was so ausgestreckt , where he was so extended .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars per year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative of a einkommen , under 600,000 dollars a year under 600,000 dollars a year .
so perhaps this technological change is clear because the fact that there was always a different truth , which is that every human being in society can make something very besonderess and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt to that is our biggest capacity .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i wondered something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in einzelligen organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information in the cell is going to run into both tochterzellen .

heinrich , because you think it &apos;s a male -- although i &apos;m not told you that it &apos;s with xy -- because you assume that it &apos;s male , it can become a male , you know , what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing such progress in the realm of anatomy that we have to make a point where we need to say that democracy is based on anatomy ?
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i talked about a few years ago , who had a few siamesische twins who had a few siamesische twins in order to make a name .
what we learned from kulturübergreifenden studies is that women , on average -- not every one , but on average -- tend to be complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable to the group of people who are vulnerable .
i &apos;m going to tell you a study that i &apos;m going to describe to you about with gur huberman , emir kamenica , wei jang , in which we were making decisions for retirement of almost a million americans in the entire united states .
i told you about four techniques , which is the problem of the problem that problem -- is short -- you &apos;ll get the überflüssigen alternatives , konkretisieren -- make it real ; we &apos;re getting more and more and more -- we can prepare more with more categories .
in this -- what i did is i took this code -- the code made out of normal letters , which we use to use , and i &apos;ve written my visitenkarte on a piece of dna , and i have 10 ^ 22 times .
and finally , i think that , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so inspiring , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not the things that we &apos;re developing , not to our intellect and mind .
about an hour after she got home , after i sent her home , she collapsed and the family called 911 , and the rettungsassistenten brought them back to the notfallstation with a blood pressure from 50 , which is a dangerous schockzustand .
but if you buy a new farblaserdrucker today in 2011 , and print a page , then this page has bright yellow flecke on each side of the site , in a pattern that makes the page clear on you and your printer .
you know , it &apos;s not only meant to eat people eating food , if they &apos;re in retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go to the subway , it means the decisions that they &apos;re going to miss great amounts of their employers .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less content with the outcome of choice than we had the opportunity to decide between less .
but , as we think , the only way that we think about biology is a huge impact without the cost of the cost of food or the limitation of their availability , if we look at co2 as the material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go through this path , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to work with cells that path .
and the gentleman with this premise with this premise then , for example , is trying to , for example , brian degger in england , has taken a minimallabor , and then , you know , genommen , it &apos;s a dampfdruckkochtopf , and , you know , suppenbrühe , and then , you know , suppenbrühe , it works .
i &apos;ve tried to do this in my lab , a little bit of scale , and then bought me so second-hand-equipment on ebay and made a little bit more d.n.a analysis , trying to do a vaterschaftstest , so that &apos;s the way home , the home .
and yeah , so , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively relatively relative , so there &apos;s a lot of people who do that in the home alone , to the large , to the big , and the larger organizations that are going to do that as well .
so if i do that now the profiler on the scene of crime , then they go there , and then they do that kind of thing , and then they can do this method , and then they can say , o.k , that hair belongs to this man .
with total transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s going on in the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the lasagne pferdefleisch and no beef , or other phenomena , i want to just vertuschen it and want to do it .
he spoke in a very heiteren and geselligen clay , and hillary clinton , and hillary clinton , like the dodgers , would never make it into the baseball world , and that &apos;s all about the tückischen passage of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
this curiosity also turned out that when i was not in school , through the forests of the forests , they went and collected and collected , frogs , frogs and snakes , and bugs and bugs , all the way home .
so i wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they believed that molecules were in a particular way , a random way of thinking about nature .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid to do it , because we have a million of people from the flourishing .
would i take this post seriously , i was born into a world that someone like me would perceive as a person who could live in any way in any way , but i &apos;m going to take the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
i may be more likely to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to be overcome , but that we &apos;re open to it , they &apos;re going to be able to put them on the schopf to put them on the schopf , and maybe even dance .

i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be right in terms of people , because i need to admit that i have to know a series of golden retriever , which probably demands the benefits of some people i know .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , this day , when you put the roof up , you get images of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever &quot; is that everything from above up to the end , from the very beginning to the end , is completely labeled with brands -- from the titelsponsor , which you &apos;ll see in the movie .
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people are going to do and i want to do all of these things , because i don &apos;t want to do it , because i don &apos;t want to bother them .
so the question i have for you all here : if it comes to the big , important things that we have to do together , we &apos;ll only be a lot of voices , will we only be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
well the problem is that the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult position of native americans , they look as a orginiell and farbenfroh , but somehow to spread the past , as the real world , which is our world , fortschreitet .
this curious event was that i &apos;ve written a book recently -- a biography called „ eat , pray , love , love , love , who decided to come out of some of the previous books in the world of some reason and a big mega-ereignis , international policy policy .

and when i stop a halboval , we don &apos;t even see a unit , which is a circle , circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , a circle , another .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to another , we can go from a lot to many things , and see patterns that would otherwise be hidden ?
so there &apos;s a great deal here . there are challenges in the transmission , and if we say that the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they have to deal with the risk of where the energy is from .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not going to take us a line between male and female , or between male and female and female and female and female , we are it that line that line .
so we started with some volunteers that we &apos;ve been talking about a little bit more than a year ago , in seattle , to tag things that you can see -- different kinds of things that you might see -- things that you might see .
the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re going to engage the people in order to do something and to change the environment -- almost like we call it a scheunentor , but with a cloud .
this made me a different human being than my friends under the kwakiutl who believe that these forests of aufenthaltsort and the gebogenen geister are the kannibalischen of the world , who are geister in the world &apos;s nordende .
there are 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t mitzählen the 10 extra olivenöle and 12 balsamico-essig that you could buy to make a big amount of your own armor , in which unlikely fall is not going to be the &apos; 175 .
but the process and the heavy beklemmung that surrounds him was when he turned out the genius , where he didn &apos;t think of it as anger , and he was going to see where he was going to come from . he realized that he didn &apos;t have a verinnerlichtes thing .
so if you look at google glasses , then it &apos;s such a concept of what the virtual world is able to combine with the real world , which means our affinität to the virtualisierung , which is the virtual as something that is normal , more natural than anything .
because we have this selbsttäuschung , this sense , to be great , of the highest creatures , not from one such kind of naturebene , of something like this kind of thing , which is something that exists to be more accurate than one organism , which is for us .
later on the day , i went around on this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be like , &quot; for a place that seems to be like , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators , but a farm that literally is a wasser-aufbereitungsanlage , and not just for those fish , but for you .
this was the surrealste form of a déjà-vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i turn on each corner , i knew what was going on in the lichtkegel of the vehicle , because i went to the film for months when we went to the film .
i took them with them , and i gave them access to the world at the bottom : astrobiologen , planetenwissenschaftler , people who were interested in such extreme situations . i took them to the sources so that they could take samples and test instruments , and so on .
you do it for the task to be the challenge , and the ocean is the herausforderndste environment that exists . you do it for the entdeckerrausches , and because of the weird link , that comes when a small group of people forming a team .
and then there is a erinnerndes self , and the self self is that , the mitzählt and the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor is given to the question : &quot; how did you feel lately ? &quot;

and dr. kean kept telling , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they didn &apos;t say anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , they can do a lot of things . &quot;
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and everyone in italy grows in italy with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is something very interesting about the last decades .
and i was committing to the site , and my father and his brother and his father -- &quot; well , my proposal is : tony is speaking , we &apos;ll get a device and we &apos;ll find a way that he can get his art back . &quot;
the leaders of government in honduras would be rely on the help of partnerländern , they could benefit from their partnerländern , they would benefit from the laws of the law that they would do for the charter , that everyone can really take advantage of the charter .
in that we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation around 20 percent and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise of four percent in the amount that they were willing to pay for .
the woman parks came back again to montgomery , where she traf. two of her oldest friends , these older women , johnnie carr , who had the montgomery-busboykott -- an incredible afroamerikanerin -- and virginia durr , who was a husband whose husband , clifford durr , dr. king vertrat .
the older black man stood up . he saw the deputy , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to tell this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give up . &quot; don &apos;t give up . &quot;
and in this song , we &apos;re going to get the opportunity to be able to be what we are : people with fully consciousness that are aware of the importance that all humans and gardens are being able to thrive , and there are great moments of optimism .
and there was a time when there was only jeans in a way , and they bought them , and they were sick , they were incredibly unkomfortabel , and they were oft , and they were oft , they &apos;d come up with &quot; ok . &quot;
finally , a consequence of the kaufens of a bad lie , if there is only one way to buy that if they &apos;re dissatisfied , and ask themselves why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible .
so she goes to the house , and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem goes through her and she reaches a pen just as it durch through her and then she said -- she was like that with her other hand .
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody that , as it happens in inspiration often , for him , is elusive , and he wants it , and he can &apos;t believe it . he can &apos;t believe it .
this really works , that &apos;s going to be done in academia , and then we thought , you know , o.k , we might have taken a webcam , you know , a webcam , the lens , the lens , the lens , abgemacht , then you have a microscope floating around .
and before the background , i was in the area of natural user interface interface , so the next generation in terms of human computers in the future of human computers , how our tools of the computer , how our tools or the computer sukzessive changes from the machine to the digital assistant .
and you can see that you have a little of our seven senses , most people think we &apos;ve only got seven , it &apos;s already seven , because it &apos;s probably seven , you know , in the near future , and as well as an extension of our self .
i &apos;m probably , you know , the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m probably the generation that &apos;s made for this bad öko image , because i &apos;ve been starting to study engineering , engineering , technology , now , i think , a kit .
now , what you could do with the patient a , and we actually did clinical clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been working , you could actually get the darmspiegelung of the patient a verlängern by simply putting the hose into it without too much .
i &apos;ve read this list of a friend of mine , and i had to laugh , and it was so ridiculous , but i just came up until &quot; zugerichtet &quot; and i couldn &apos;t get to read , and i had no more weitersprechen , and i had to start reading and emotionalen emotional .
you know , as michelangelo shaped shaped the moses , it says he was at the end of the day , and he &apos;s actually able to see him on moses -- actually , you can see a little spot -- and i said , &quot; perché non parli ? why don &apos;t you go ? &quot;
they knew that every year , roughly 75,000 years old , their country left around to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country , and they can do exactly the same thing in honduras .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really looks like is somebody who he &apos;s looking for when he &apos;s eingeschneit , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the brandbekämpfung when he &apos;s zugedeckt .
so what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking do is we think about a certain kind of narrative , we &apos;re thinking about this machine , and the machine , and the machine that makes this machine far beyond , better and faster than we could ever do .
we looked back at the geneaologie eight generations , and found two cases of a natural death , and when we looked at the people with pixar , they gave up that one of the people had gotten so old that he died because of his old age , and we killed him with the spear .
they ran like the devil in the house , and they were following from this poem , and it was just that they had to get fast enough to get a piece of paper and a pen , so they could capture it and capture on the sheet .
these are the people who have more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and working with scientists with these kinds of technologies , and they &apos;re asking for these technologies to auseinanderzusetzen and asking , and that &apos;s where we &apos;re doing all kinds of things .
the first project we did as an international group , as we were sort of consciously aware of ourselves , is there as a real scene , and we are online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re going to know the people who are getting together and so forth .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and with that sentence , i want to conclude , a and again , again , a little bit of the evidence , also , to make a difference , to get to new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
this is actually a nice thing to do when you do this , so agriculture makes power , biogas , on a hectare of five people in favelas , with a ton of thousands of dollars with a farmer &apos;s worth of a farmer , and they &apos;re waiting for the plant and the pig and the chickens and the chickens and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish .
here you have this zensor between the unbewussten and the conscious , which immediately anspringt , without doing something about it , and the things that you know , from which you know that they &apos;re very different from them , and the things that you can see .
maybe this is a moderaten contribution , and if you do better than i expect , that would be great , but my favorite thing here is that we need to work on all of those five , and we can &apos;t give up any significant problems because they have significant problems .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never be able to simulate reasonable , if it could work , but there &apos;s a modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes , yes , it &apos;s made up .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo-effekt . it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , unless you look at it like , &quot; a delusion , &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to be true if you &apos;re just holding it enough . &quot;
so where the founding fathers were really bedacht to figure out how individuals could be protected before the state , it is possible that if we put more mothers into this concept , we &apos;re not just going to be able to do a concept of what to do , but how we can care for each other .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the greatest part of my career , and it &apos;s all just for the trying to study social art that they &apos;re compelling and interesting , and hopefully , and hopefully , in a way , what makes them useful and accessible to the audience .
and the finding of president lobo was that the confidence that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to get the foreign investors and build the city for all the parties in honduras for many years , which have been suffering for many years and mistrust .
but i remember the lights of the ölplattform coast , and the young man , who broke up and died and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and on the flavor of the first apfels , which gave me one of the men on the platform .
so a few years ago , i set up a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year of sabbatical and work in an environment that &apos;s pretty much everything you &apos;re going to hate , in the government .
so the next few weeks , i was worried , and i learned for the first time , the junk shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the kinds of healthy shame you feel because you cannot talk to the colleagues about it .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it not better that ? &quot; the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we all talk about one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a yoruba . let &apos;s be kantonesisch .
there are a lot of pilotprojekte that can do this at 60 percent -- 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to be a 100 percent , and it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get the lagerung of the co2 , which is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the lagerzeitfrage .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s the kind of smart thing when you get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse of a conversation about whether you have the things that are coming faster , if you expect things to get faster than we expect .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you &apos;ve done that , that the erlebende self is a bad bit of your body , and you have power to get a lot better off , because now you have the patient a lot better , because now you have a better story about his experience .
i didn &apos;t seem to do a single thing , and i didn &apos;t seem to repeat it with these big , elastic bändern -- in different colors -- and i hated this spacecraft , and i hated this bänder more than anything else . i hated it . i hated it . i hated her .
so , what does that mean if we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space in evolution , and most of us in the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a number of possibilities .
so in a very simple fashion , in a very simple form , there &apos;s a place that is a place that is a place where it &apos;s beginning to be a place that is the beginning that , in the beginning , the gesetze that lies there , and the people will determine the ability to live either under these rules or not .
now in the world of sparens , i think , one of the best examples that have recently come to the market , about how you best have the choice , was something that david laibson has very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
i wanted to go back to the lottery and the comfort of life of an unknown vororts -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who abschlossen each of her every day , and she said , &quot; well , three years , we &apos;re still in the same bed .
at that point , the patients come in . they can &apos;t just take control of the control of their own ship , but can also help us in the face of the challenges that are faced in front of us , and the kostenexplosion of health care , and so on .
&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; which my friends call at autodesk , &quot; infinite-computing , &quot; sensors , and the networks , the robot , the 3d printer , the 3d structure that allows us to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , nano-materialien and artificial intelligence .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical göttliches creatures , which believed it was literally in the walls of a künstlerateliers -- sort of like dobby , the hauself , the hauself , the künstler of work .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- all the gods and the mysteries , and there &apos;s no more room for the mystische of divinity .
and it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a social problem , which is how things simplify , so any problemstellung , a question , and how you can do that better , and how you can do it better .
and then came from the do-it-yourself-bio org website of the founder , and has said , well , we &apos;ve got to actually meet ourselves now , even real , and then have two things organized , one in london , zweitausend , in the london , zehn , in san francisco .
this is when you focus a laser beam , on one in the room , then you can capture little particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then move into that focus , which is , like , you know , , you know , this kind of thing , you know , this kind of thing , like a traktorbeamstrahl in the principle .
i was afraid , not meinetwegen , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could break into one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship with the violin , if i started to talk about scale and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didaktischen .
i had this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which was the messlatte effect of visual effects and computergenerierter effects in the whole new altitudes , with a broader human , expressive characters , expressive characters that were produced by cg , and the world should be cg .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermalquellen , and sometimes things that i hadn &apos;t seen before , sometimes things that hadn &apos;t seen before , and for the science that we saw , had never found any words .
and when i think about it , i think about a holiday that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best holiday that i had ever had , and i think quite often about how often i think about other kinds of things .
so what you got was this : your name here : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and the content eventually could eventually fly to the ears , especially if i put your company stupid for your participation .
so , by putting color , contrast and contrast to the edge of the edges , the individual images , fotografische , addiert mängel , wie colors and dysfunction , we verwischen the boundaries between the various images and the störungen , and let &apos;s look like a single picture , which is basically hundreds of levels of levels .
and when these people came and watched who &apos;s the best protein-ordner of the world , it wasn &apos;t a mit-professor , it wasn &apos;t a caltech-student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was the president of the day and the best protein-ordnerin in the world .
the computervision-algorithmen have made these images together so that they put the real room in which these images all around the grassi were made in the canadian rockies , and you can see the elements of stabilisierten slides , or panoramischer , and these things were all held in relation to each other .
but if we look at this metabolic map that &apos;s very simple , in comparison to us . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all of these genes we can eliminate , it &apos;s very unlikely that it would lead to a living cell .
but we don &apos;t even zucken if we hear somebody like this , because we know this kind of talk for a long time ago . somehow we have the notion of verinnerlicht and collective accepted that creativity and suffering , of course , leads that creativity and suffering , at the end .
in others , she was not very quick , and she ran and ran , and ran , but she didn &apos;t break the house , and she didn &apos;t break the poem , and she would go through the house , and she would look for her .
well , not exactly what i hoped i had , but i went -- the stairs up , the hallway , along the hallway , the real thing to do with the &quot; real &quot; feuerwehrmännern , &quot; which was actually quite finished to get a few shoes .
another example : a few years ago , i got the call one of the 19 years old , who was born as a boy who was born as young , he had a friend , he had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend .
so we have a situation where , the further our science technology , we have to really appreciate that these categories that we &apos;ve thought of as robust anatomische categories , which made very simple zuordnungen to create permanent identitätskategorien , are much more nuanced than we &apos;ve imagined .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in the case of the case , where a man who &apos;s attracted to other men , is being punished with death , unless it &apos;s prepared to participate in , because it &apos;s going to be ready to participate in life .
we have this lebensplan , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to pass a hand and not did , all the fences that i wanted to do and never did .
but in fact , let &apos;s see it more and more and more and more that if you &apos;re ready to get too close , you know , you &apos;re going to get out there , and then you &apos;ll have an increase in sales , and you &apos;ll reduce the cost of sales , &amp; amp ; and there is a improvement in the entscheidungswahrnehmung .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down on the friday , everybody &apos;s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday . gettin , friday . you didn &apos;t think that we were going to lead this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
how often do we have a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re expecting ourselves , and we expect the government to reflect our values , and then we don &apos;t have a lot of change ?
the reason for that is , if i would draw it on a regular curve , where , let &apos;s say , this is the years , so the timeline of a kind , and this is a random rate of technology that i want to share with you with a graph .
and where do you see how far away we were , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , and how sad we are at all the earth , you can see that , for example , there &apos;s a program that &apos;s going to be a program , for 20 40 dollars .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to 70 to three percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest of the rest that last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which will be very , very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work out of batteries .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way that it &apos;s causing information and the way it &apos;s causing information is not one , two , three , but you see them as a group .
well , i like a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the zehren of memories , but even if you have more of them , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give the memories so much weight to the weight that we give ?
in our desire to protect people who are on the heart , and they tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical forecast , or even a forecast of the quality of life that they expect , we have to find out that we &apos;re not going to actually be disabled .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideenreichtum , with which you put new elements in the game -- like the testicles , and also how the game makes trust as well as much fun .
and what we &apos;ve done was , actually , a new kind of network that was used in the world -- that &apos;s a mobiltelefonnetz -- and anonymous information from that network that &apos;s used to use to understand how the city works .
but there &apos;s only one company , a agency ready to help us -- and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve known john bond for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , and i had to go to the company .
so we &apos;ve done a study that i &apos;ve done with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , and we did a study with the people who have been working with the people who were working for ing -- and these people were all in a gathering where they signed their participation .
these older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr. , stevenson , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking to the people that you should stop saying that we should have the first time in our nation &apos;s history . &quot;
in my about 20 years of medical training and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study about medical errors and wrong , for one of my first papers , which i could do for the star , &quot; white coat , &quot; to learn to learn the &quot; white coat . &quot;
i think a signifikanter -- not the only thing , but a signifikanter beiträger to that explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the enttäuschend because their standards are so high , and then if they have to explain these experiences , think about it .
a group of ankara that i met a while ago , that &apos;s a studentengruppe that would like to convey the public , which they wanted to learn in university , and they &apos;ve tried to explain to people what they &apos;re learning about , and they tried to explain what &apos;s wrong .
a lot of you will know the story , because of steves articles that became a book , again , a book , again , with robert lopez , as steve lopez , and jamie foxx als , who ended up with his paranoide , who was diagnosed with his paranoide , and he was diagnosed with schizophrenia schizophrenia .
bill gates : to make the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we only have a few 10 million , and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s working in the 100en million .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a frage-und-antwort-sitzung for one of my lectures , who told a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and it was a perfectly good-looking music , and it was a very glorious music .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the verzweigungen in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all available spezien have been in the spitzen of those branches of those branches in evolutionary terms : you have survived ; it has its surroundings .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could still tell you much more about the experience and the many other wonderful things that you can do with interaction , but i want to talk to the second part of the environment that we talked about at the beginning and that &apos;s the betätigung of our environment .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re going to be afraid of , they &apos;re going to be afraid , and they &apos;re going to make them , and they &apos;re actually turning them into a positive , and that is a geschickter schachzug .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 markenpartner , which was ready to give up on this control that would make a difference with somebody who was doing so much , and then , eventually , to tell us stories that would never have been able to tell you -- stories that would normally never be supported .
this is a rekonstruktion of the cathedral notre dame , who just held in the computer with the pictures of flickr , and you &apos;ll just get to marc dame in flickr , and you &apos;ll get images of men in t-shirts , and you &apos;ll get a picture that was discovered as a model that was discovered as this model .
you know ? i think you might be able to think he thinks he or she is like the gourd , like the pelvis and the essence and the source and the source of all divinity , kreativen , unendlichen , unendlichen , unendlichen , aufzubürden , aufzubürden , is a little bit too much responsible for you .
the people in the back or the ones that eventually look at video , they &apos;ll say , &quot; well , yes , this looks quite impressive , but if it was real , it would be a little bit , but if it was really , it would be a hole , and if it was really real . &quot;
this may seem to be a little bit more abwegig , so again , i mean , so i can make it work , if we &apos;re going to solve problems like hunger , poverty , global , global , global , global conflict , i think , to play games online at least 21 billion hours a week .
it would be great , if we &apos;re using this paradigm of the standard , or the strength , to actually make it a little bit more dangerous , so we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills to society .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bakterielles chromosome , and it has more than 580.000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we could build it in tapes of the size of the virus to understand what the individual components of a living cell are .
and then when you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen , it &apos;s going to look like , you know , why neunundneunzig percent of our current software is slightly intuitively intuitively intuitive or not nutzbar , including , in a lot of different ways of being the classic software .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and to do that with nasa , and in the nasa-sachverständigenrat , and in fact , they &apos;re planning to plan , and they &apos;re going to go to russia , through the mission of the mission of the mission , and then they &apos;re going to go to the international weltraumstation .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering introduced the national academy for francis arnold , and willem stemmer , two scientists who developed independent techniques of evolution to work with the natural process of evolution , and to lead to wünschenswerte proteins .
if i show you 600 magazines , and you put them in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll give you 400 magazines , and these in 20 categories , they think i &apos;d give you more choices and a better auswahlerfahrung than i had given you the 400 .
and that &apos;s when you all have your feelings about politics and the snake , and all the other things that we really upset about , is government , in the core of tim o reilly , &quot; what we &apos;re doing in common , &quot; which we &apos;re not able to do alone .
if you ever have to have the chance to work in your backyard , like your fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- in fact , do all of you -- are you going to see that people who are going to do a lot of different problems , including a lot of different problems in their house .
and from a conversation today with dean kaman , one of the innovators of doing it , i &apos;d like to share something with you -- he gave me the permission -- he gave me the permission -- his technolgie , which is the slingshot , and the many of you may have heard about . it &apos;s the size of a kühlschranks in the classroom .
no biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are just a moment ago , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet , this -- the apokalyptischste szenarium on the field of biological diversity .
and that was really , very , very bitter , and then you go into this kind of phase , just showing a picture where i was asked for 10 years , a thousand d-mark , a thousand d-mark , of course , in the course of course , whether that really should be the great thing .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i figured that -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds long . what does it mean in a life , you know , about 600 million of them , in a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 .
