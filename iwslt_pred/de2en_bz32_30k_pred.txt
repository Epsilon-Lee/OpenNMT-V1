thank you .
we go through initiationsrituale .
it &apos;s interesting .
very expensive real estate .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m a novelist .

that &apos;s hard .
not entmutigt .
this is felix .
the sun goes up .
the orange canyon .
yeah , hi .
fantastic , right ?
that &apos;s wrong .
long , yes .
yes , milliseconds .
the only chance .
nullemissionen , yes ?
not instead .
that &apos;s efficient .
all the umweltdiskussion .
not toxic inside .
but it is .
yeah , kind of .
music as a language .
lento , slow .
i wonder .
that &apos;s the singing .
you need time .
a autistischer student .
that &apos;s fast .
here it is .
this is vorbildlich .
not very sustainable .
they schlemmen . &quot;
that was fascinating .
an awful challenge .
we need energiewunder .
thank you . thank you !
bg : thank you .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s awful .
shame . embarrassing .
he works like this .
very different term .
we know that .
dk : 60,000 .
and he says ...
a few less .
we were .
it has sensors .
i swear .
does that sound good ?
after a week .
you can go .
i grabbed awe .
thank you .
that was incredible .
not a hospital .
thank you .
not yet .
this is scary .
it &apos;s generisch .
yeah . okay .
a lot .
jk : both .
i can help .
i was amazed .
swarm is blank .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m tom .
thank you .
i created one .
are they all ?
we lose them .
oh my god !
ohhhhh , wowwww !
there were remixes .
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
we were poor .
home where ?
centers were set up .
my gut again .
that &apos;s not ...
do it again .
we raise off .
i vertrete children .
or bombs .
it would be intolerable .
it would be gewissenlos .
we love innovation .
we love entertainment .
oh my god .
schlafmangel is ubiquitous .
there are online-kriminelle .
they sell zertifikate .
they durchbohrten each other .
thank you very much .
these days are over .
what do you want to do ?
they actually hurt .
everyone needs a goldfischglas .
this was the result .
i find them abscheulich .
can we change it ?
just do your job .
it affects the speicherbecken .
this is about christmas .
this is the last .
good work ! yes !
so let &apos;s see .
yeah , good afternoon .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
they had no mass media .
yeah , it goes .
what are media today ?
they have similar principles .
why does this happen at all ?
does anybody see a particular thing ?
a dalmatiner , right .
i see the dalmatiner .
that &apos;s our present .
what does fünfundzwanzig milliseconds take ?
give pee a chance .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
i want to tell you .
no tree is kohlenstoffneutral .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we can do it differently .
and it has to go back .
wonderful , huh ?
but the wrong stuff .
what do you say ?
each waste is nährstoff .
so not like detox .
we can do that .
does it make the curious thing ?
the work of interpreten .
so , compare it .
all of this interest me .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
you see it immediately .
i can argue everything .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
yeah , good afternoon .
the names today .
we were 20 people .
that &apos;s what it is .
this is the system .
what a fish .
i wanted to supported them .
let &apos;s call him please .
that &apos;s actually me .
what did they do ?
they fluteten the channels .
the farm is incredible .
there is no food .
can i be honest ?
and i was an artist .
it was really profound .
who will make it safe ?
next : nuklearenergie .
that &apos;s great .
that &apos;s a wish .
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
who &apos;s at the most successful ?
what was the result ?
there are also weltrekorde .
and i understand that .
people were playing crazy .
we &apos;re talking about it .
the data came in .
but you know what ?
not very often happens .
he &apos;s called paul offit .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
dark urine . dark .
there was no cantaloupe-melonen .
why do we do that ?
it &apos;s not a country .
because you know what ?
yeah , i know .
how do we know ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
thank you , danny kahneman .
so they do that .
it may sound nasty .
players are not sitting around .
glückselige productivity . fantastic !
that &apos;s exciting .
from conflicts creativity .
there &apos;s no ordinary man .
oh , so the .
that &apos;s very good .
a couple more .
what about longevity ?
maybe 10 times the same .
he opens the door .
why not live longer ?
these are going to be unwiderstehlich .
so it &apos;s true .
they &apos;re all important .
be a mentor .
who are these related ones ?
play is not silly .
so where do we go ?
ooh , thank you .
thank you very much .
first verlängerung , second .
italy wins . yeah .
here &apos;s the video .
his name is tempt .
i stood around him .
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
they were secretly .
that sounds einflößend .
you could see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
almost identical structure .
the power plant can explode .
i have a question .
that would have been okay .
that &apos;s very risky .
this is the kurzfassung .
überlegene technology .
it keeps you fresh .
hmmm , my brand ?
my name is amit .
i see this pluszeichen .
polite have all been polite .
first , simple .
but you know what ?
how do you care ?
let me sum up .
so how does this work ?
what &apos;s happened here ?
this was jimmy kimmel .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i lived in parallelwelten .
i don &apos;t know .
is it at all photography ?
what creates the illusion ?
oh . a moment .
okay . thank you .
so you meet al .
and that &apos;s important .
they use their hands .
there are two options .
i go in here .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
the silence is ohrenbetäubend .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we &apos;re constantly hitting each other .
i thought about it .
i don &apos;t think so .
that was great .
here &apos;s an example .
let &apos;s talk about wasser-kriege .
what do these people need ?
hey , why not ?
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
a thousand , very good .
i learned everything .
but i continued to work .
asked the nurse story .
so she was back .
they gave her their blutdruckerhöher .
their family gathered together .
and she did .
and i continued to work .
he actually collected fish .
it was a zackenbarsch .
what &apos;s happened here ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing today .
we have three hauptgruppen .
these people make money .
this is alfred gonzalez .
diginotar is a zertifizierungsstelle .
privacy has to be given .
the stones are farbcodiert .
i &apos;ll stop that .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
the living people have the spirits .
now , what does that mean ?
so , what does that mean ?
inflation nations are sending our fernsehkanal .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
the official dogma of what ?
these are all einnehmende questions .
here &apos;s another example .
third , eskalation of expectations .
do you want jeans with holes ?
but i felt bad .
we just signed in first .
why should we do that ?
seriously -- the fall of falling .
and i always had .
why not think about that ?
this is a jährlicher tauwasserfluss .
these rivers take very quickly .
the wassermengen have expanded .
leave that for us .
they really loved it .
this is an interactive trickfilmanwendung .
his own story is invent .
so , why now hack ?
you see that down there .
how do we actually work people ?
that sounds basically unusual .
they didn &apos;t have books .
let &apos;s make a little zwischenbilanz .
from the vogt-zeitalter to the maschinenzeitalter .
we don &apos;t produce anymore .
it won &apos;t do it .
pattern recognition should work .
now , you see the dalmatiner .
a very exciting phenomenon .
you have to understand that .
this is the so-called osit-modell .
and it depends on phosphorus .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bones .
the phosphor-problem is much more critical .
it makes leukemia in kids .
but that &apos;s not protection .
luckily , yes ?
so we &apos;re too many .
but where are we useful ?
we can get our nutrients back .
in china it was different .
the byproduct is clean water .
but we need it overall .
or take a lippenstift .
there is any footprint there .
we &apos;re in germany sustainability .
so there are two cycles .
all of it is kompostierbar .
this must be the altersunterschied .
he was over 18 .
his personal impressionen of seerosen .
that &apos;s what most people here know .
this is like sprechenlernen .
because you can train that .
have you ever been jealous ?
it &apos;s against justice .
it will always give you more and more .
it &apos;s interested in feuermachen .
he &apos;s listed .
because i can say everything .
these things are logical correctly .
it &apos;s not that soul .
this is a naturding .
this is the study of naturdinge .
it &apos;s busy beschäftigt .
there are four and a half thousand people .
it &apos;s just not technological .
what would all be done ?
and here &apos;s the plot again .
and then they set up .
i just loved two loved .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
to one , great .
let &apos;s call him .
it &apos;s kind of verkuppelt us .
the chef had verkocht him .
he showed up the algae .
but what do your fish eat ?
how is the futterverwertung ? &quot;
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
i almost never do .
i don &apos;t like that question .
you want to feed the world ?
now i see greg lemond .
so they saw something magical .
that &apos;s cool . &quot;
what have we learned ?
it &apos;s constant all the time .
first we have the population .
today , 6,8 billion people live .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
in addition to these sources .
and there &apos;s the lagerungsproblem .
it really solves the treibstoffproblem .
what should our testimony look like ?
this has the biggest impact .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we have to spread the message .
this is just a versicherungsmethode .
and even lomborg thinks .
it was a huge success .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and then to realize it .
so i tried something interesting .
so what do you think happened ?
there &apos;s a schritt-für-schritt-anleitung there .
and why is that ?
diphterie , röteln , kinderlähmung ...
the result of this was devastating .
because here is somebody begging ?
so paul is a terrorist terrorist .
the data is all the time .
i agree with you completely .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i &apos;ll push my sleeve back .
but the key thing is ...
yeah , here it is .
there &apos;s a lot of glücks-coaching .
but it didn &apos;t .
he had the experience .
there &apos;s an old study .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
they have so much uncertainty .
so the correlation is small .
it &apos;s not true for emotion .
and there are plenty of staff .
so the first aufrechte primate .
and finally , epic matters .
they create a epic story .
edward castronova is a volkswissenschaftler .
that sounds crazy , right ?
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
the game is from 2007 .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
i think it &apos;s rather not .
how about fitness ?
is it all einbildung ?
or is it possible maybe ?
some are came and went .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
i wanted to hold ourselves healthy .
it cost billions of dollars .
these changes are coming in .
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
play is not just kinderspiele .
and this is called androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so what did years after that ?
and women do that successfully .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
is it going to be my size ?
will i like the color ?
good afternoon , everyone together .
here you see the city .
you see the timeline .
they saw the big characteristic .
and then they all went down .
it really loved him .
you can have this cloud .
you can see roberto dancing .
so here you see it .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
no insurance can be querstellen .
it turns off the engines .
i had a good life .
it feels great .
you see the water coming .
but it was very sad .
and then something funny happened .
and that worked very well .
and it was even better .
but it gets worse .
is that your opinion ?
i &apos;m a redundante person .
that was more appropriate .
put the camera out .
what else is more risky ?
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
that &apos;s a great question .
and that &apos;s a millionen-konzern .
thank you for your patience .
yes . good .
it &apos;s very good .
what other brands do they do ?
that &apos;s a great question .
and it took 18 months .
i grew up in india .
so you just go to googleartproject.com. .
just further . much fun .
these are all metadaten .
you see something fun here .
apparently it was quite popular .
they come from the artists .
the answer to that is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
so , again , he showed him .
the two calls me .
it sums up a thousand square kilometers .
one place is south korea .
here &apos;s the olive hit .
here &apos;s her marmeladen gait .
third technology : kategorisierung .
here are two different schmuckauslagen .
okay , a few more .
what am i looking at ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
and then it became international .
something versteifte me .
loans were looking for them .
so i followed my gut feeling .
after just a journey there .
is it about the light ?
here &apos;s another example .
but it requires a lot of planning .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
i work in the solartechnologie-branche .
it &apos;s grown very rapidly .
so scott gets this anfruf .
they combined these two people .
did you see these guys ?
something very strange happens here .
so that &apos;s what you see .
that &apos;s about it .
it has billions of them .
maybe some mutations will lead .
but they do the job .
so it creates a rückkopplung .
that made me really sad .
but what do we do with that ?
and this opens up a map .
these are the apsaras .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
i will never forget that .
my brother was staring at me .
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to confess to you .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
the only country in the world .
i vertrete people in todeszellen .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
we love technology and creativity .
she &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
we want to eradicate masseninhaftierungen .
sometimes i push too much .
so i went to the court .
once the judge saw me .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
they are inspirational personalities .
crisis . death . disaster .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
and a lot of people forget this .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
we &apos;re thinking about energieknappheit today .
and there &apos;s good news .
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
and so it was .
i felt really good .
actually , i made two mistakes .
my second mistake was worse .
the notfallpersonal was all the strands .
and then it happened again .
he always showed up here .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
and it &apos;s the crux .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
my name is brian spencer .
it &apos;s about veränderbare normwerte .
it was my first sonnenbrand .
and they &apos;re going to run five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it was still fish .
this is a dead turtle .
once we started a living room .
she wasn &apos;t ertrunken .
it &apos;s not going to document .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
what do you do with zertifikaten ?
the firmenhauptquartier is right here .
they tap their internet connection .
privacy is not the debate .
so littlebits open source is open source .
they &apos;re the heimatländer of somebody .
our magazines are sent by millions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
the answer is no . &quot;
a has these benefits and risks .
today , everything is easy to have .
the answer is yes .
second , what economists call oppertunitätskosten .
you could have done it better .
so let me remind you .
economists call this an application application .
we &apos;ve created unique elements here .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
it caused huge amounts of control in the control room .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
okay , that &apos;s really what makes real courage .
so , you know , you know .
so the question is : how ?
what is that thing ?
go and quäle cohen cohen .
this is god , you know ?
the dauereis is with red marks .
this is a completely unhaltbares entwicklungsmuster .
this picture reminded me of something .
here he is going to the sun .
now i add a bass .
it was a pretty schickes project .
or they didn &apos;t have any fotolitografie .
no , no , no .
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is a game for the outside .
for example , this perception in context .
does anybody know what that is ?
so it &apos;s n .
this is also a paradigm shift .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
we depend on two countries .
and we take it all up .
people over the urine .
there &apos;s no überbevölkerungsproblem on trees .
and we &apos;re too many .
imagine mozart efficient .
that &apos;s the minimum result .
not all should be kompostierbar .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
technical crabs are the same .
when it &apos;s right now , the waste is .
i started a institute .
so , a translation of translation .
the beweggründe , it &apos;s writing .
how did he feel ?
have a nice example of that .
this is a getragenes part .
because for me , she means memory .
now , the instruments have fortentwickelt .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
and how did that feel ?
i &apos;m shooting through the head .
the mechanism comes from lying .
picasso says , wait , just wait .
my wife told me it .
here you have this little mechanism .
we can &apos;t just do that .
and then he can just davonlaufen .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i was particularly indifferent him .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
and automatically , he &apos;s going to the right idea .
again , you have it again .
and they have a problem .
thank you for your attention .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
it can &apos;t be a problem .
natürlicht is then bietet .
so smart-grid , a riesenthema everywhere .
and of course , this is incredibly crude .
this is going to happen in the next april .
for nathaniel , music means seelische health .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i said , &quot; hühnchen-pellets ? &quot;
i entliebte myself from this fish .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and green was a disaster .
they literally umgelegt the lever .
schlemmen ? i was completely confused .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
he shook his head , no .
this is a netzwerk network .
one billion people are being starving today .
the creativity had to hold out .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
they live with chemosynthese .
so this was really changed the dynamic .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
in fact , the fortschrittsgesellschaft is based on energiefortschritten .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so that &apos;s a tough thing to do .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
this is going to become a key shift .
among other things , other things should not suffer .
the marshmallow must be on top .
they &apos;re not investing time in machtkämpfe .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
my grandparents complained that number on 70. .
we have them bezwungen . pop .
so that &apos;s the good news .
the same thing , only bigger .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
and that made me so mess .
take nothing for granted .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
nobody has ever said that before .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
this is ideology , not science .
we lehnen food .
and why ? gentechnisch food .
it &apos;s like a potato .
because we don &apos;t want to herumschieben genes ?
the dosage is a role .
and the shape plays a role .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
so what is a story about ?
they didn &apos;t change the story .
it &apos;s a completely different notion .
it was almost beyond imagination .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
but it &apos;s definitely not optimalsituation .
so this crazy story could be true .
so , we can do that .
i read the post .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
widrigkeiten are just to our lives .
and frankly , who is normal ?
i was very desperate at the time .
the students are spread into grades .
do you want to become more attractive and more confident ?
which one would you like most ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
now , how did that happen ?
and this was 19 years ago .
well , i was the next one .
hauptmann winkte me .
but the game is a formwandler .
both of these are überlebensfähig , both floating .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tiger .
monday : color is powerful .
tuesday : adaptability is totally überbewertet .
thursday : self-confidence is the key .
they &apos;re going to be in the free .
this morning , the game .
the game starts -- silence .
the data was not available before .
the whole building was water .
but the reality is always unexpected .
they can play with different kinds .
this is about five feet long .
and this video is in real time .
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
we won a couple of awards .
this is a painting of a circle .
she did it for three years .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
so we start with a windows-dropper .
this is a piece of wire , right ?
totally on a particular destination .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
this is just the arbeitstitel .
we need to think about what brands .
that would have been no problem at all .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
a whole dish is cool eating .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
these things have a positivere effect .
how would you describe your brand ?
i really like nice clothes .
lawyer : i &apos;m a anwaltsmarke .
tell me about this world .
what else do they have ?
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
the film hasn &apos;t stopped .
you go around and lust .
you want to orient yourself in the museum ?
so this is one of the images .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
i should not say that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is a picture of the object .
and we did that .
so we measured his movement .
we are driven in an area .
this is a picture of this place .
they even get funding with one .
think about your own decisions .
now we saw the opposite effect .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
here &apos;s a description of the road .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
this is a profoundly unnützes kategorisierungsschema .
who do you really want to inform ?
we need to slow down the complexity .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
well , we want .
he had uploaded a lot of naturvideos .
what &apos;s going on that day ?
that &apos;s it , very simple .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of this .
who could have been able to do that ?
the story is not over .
i never met him personally .
no , no one was an opportunity .
her mother just moved her up .
the defeat would have been too simple .
who would ever have a wish ?
i thought everybody could do that .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , a realistic level .
sometimes the perspective is an illusion .
the unterwasser-teil comes from a quarry .
how can we help you ? &quot;
and every morning i jump on that .
and we created a ipad-app .
get sure .
this is a modest little app .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call-center .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
how do i get her away ? &quot;
good night , honey beutelratte . &quot;
so the occupythesec-bewegung did it .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
but it &apos;s not that fast .
that &apos;s when we &apos;re not going .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
and these are the neural structures .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
all these generations only require a few milliseconds .
it &apos;s verworrene and strange programs .
so gewissermassen überflügelt gives us the technology .
we &apos;re in the middle of this übergangpunkt .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
i got a fear of technology .
the storytelling story always took more sense .
i talked a lot about magic .
somehow the children do not .
we use the energy of the sun .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
she was a daughter &apos;s daughter .
i should not do that .
this is going to be a public scan .
my uncle died from alkoholinduzierten diseases .
many of my clients are very young .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
i talk a lot about these questions .
do you want to listen and listen ? &quot;
what do you try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
you should also have a wish .
then he flüsterte me in the ear .
well , i entered the gerichtssaal .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
&quot; a pale blue potter . &quot;
because we live on a wasserplaneten .
the white lines are the population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-milliarden-marke .
we have the passion of a diy-innovatoren .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropen .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
it &apos;s the durchschnittsleistung of the schlägers .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
but , but you know what ?
i was a compulsively obsessiver student .
she was back and she died .
but slowly , it got it .
i started feeling better .
it &apos;s been ashamed of being ashamed of support .
but there are two problems .
i don &apos;t take the same at the same time .
all of that includes errors .
and it starts with a doctor .
it divides their experiences with others .
i &apos;ve redefined the medical doctor .
people were still happy .
and nobody seems to worry about it .
zertifizierungsbehörde hack , ausstellen ausstellen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
lego made it possible for everyone .
and it was an incredible experience .
and of course we all share the same anpassungsnotwendigkeiten .
a language is an expression of the human mind .
54 percent of deaths happened by durchbohrungen .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
you can &apos;t do something like that .
but these are all the streets in the u.s.
now let &apos;s take something else .
many of them are covered by faces and so forth .
this is my supermarket . no big .
and there are several reasons for this .
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons .
everybody in my neighborhood is gone .
well , this cartoon makes some statements .
the truth is more like this .
we started this 15 years ago .
as it turns out , it &apos;s very difficult .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
this is the hauptmechanismus of evolution here .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
we konditionierten them , reparierten them .
like algae -- and other things .
if not , somebody else today is somebody else .
his whole arbeitsprozess has changed afterwards .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
it &apos;s about a neuversorgung of america .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
so for him , they were just bauklötze .
we wanted to develop a lernmittel for sprachlerner .
so , that was my primary motivation .
and the list you can continue to continue .
now , more than these two networks .
and that &apos;s very much in the beginning .
now , what are the archaische models ?
i want to show you that one .
it &apos;s this gennante maschinenzeitalter .
on the book and on the picture .
we have a high-level language .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
maybe you have to take a look again .
so , from the modern ages .
every society is defined by a primärmedium .
at the beginning of the stammesgesellschaft through language .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
often , in the third , forgotten .
you &apos;re looking at the back of the back .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what you see .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
it has to process it as a present present .
how can i do something about it ?
and less usable or benutzungsfreundlich is it .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
i &apos;m trying to do this through a beispiels .
i mean , everybody has already eaten pies .
and the curiosity is not going to learn .
schütz the environment , make less waste .
the environment , verbrauche less energy .
this is just a little less destruction .
and it &apos;s all packaging or content .
one baby needs about six thousand diapers .
so with that , men can &apos;t be pigs .
so you can &apos;t fix that .
that means we need to zurückkriegen phosphorus .
but very effectively , yes , yes ?
that &apos;s not efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
we think of the north .
so not save , clean , avoid .
you can show , i was there .
that &apos;s what has been demonstrated right now .
there &apos;s a direct model for this .
if you come to that , yeah ?
there are this noun everywhere , almost .
we can reinvent everything again .
so every concert is a different concert .
and he said , &quot; well , did he ?
it &apos;s only lived for many years .
there &apos;s hardly going to be talked about interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
tell that what you &apos;re feeling .
it &apos;s not just a nice geräuschtapete .
and this sounds very different from before .
so the first step to an interpretation .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
no , no , no .
because now you can apply a dreisatz .
they &apos;re still familiar with school .
in this dreisatz , three sentences come in .
and here you are feeling .
he &apos;s right in the middle .
these sentences are absolutely logical and accurate .
say , there are no vorhersager .
there was the kernforschungsanlage leopoldshafen .
yes , these are the data .
you think of it as a box .
we also have very detailed data .
how far do you get there ?
and then we said , okay .
very simple , it will come .
so i just started playing .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
and so he entflieht his local state .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
you have the water vice versa .
this is where he picks up an awful gleitaar .
now he mentioned the mineralbedürfnisse of phytoplankton .
i &apos;m an expert for relations . &quot;
a fischaufzucht , but also a vogelreservat .
do you do that for your kids ? &quot;
it &apos;s this beißende , verkohlte taste .
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
you can touch in a particular year .
we &apos;re talking about the oscar curse .
so i &apos;m listening , thank you very much .
i was totally wissenschaftsbegeistert , you know .
i could draw . i could paint .
and i didn &apos;t let me feel frustrated .
so , basically , multiply my two passions .
so , that really blew me up .
we returned to the wreckage of the titanic .
so that was a very strange experience .
we have something that doesn &apos;t grow up .
for energy , this was what i noticed .
so here are some natural fireflies .
it should have the two elements .
there &apos;s a lot that needs to come together .
we have to use for more research .
anyway , we need a solution .
bg : a energiedurchbruch is the most important thing .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
but there &apos;s another reason .
because they have special skills of prozessbegleitung .
what do you think happened to these design-studenten ?
we repeated this exercise with the same student .
and that can make a big difference .
and everyone in this room has to go .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
it &apos;s not even the truth of it .
we &apos;ve got measles in this country now .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we &apos;re going to the arms of the placebo-industrie .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
it doesn &apos;t have to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patentkram .
so , look what happens .
and the goal is very simple .
i think the knife in my hand .
what ? that made me crazy .
now , i would take the needle out .
everybody would like to make the people happier .
he had had 20 minutes of herrlicher music .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
there seems to be an invisibility .
we get an absolutely flat line .
thank you so much for the invention of behavioral economics .
no , i mean it really seriously .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
five million people use it every month .
before these fantastic spielecontrollern , there were schafsknöchel .
people suffered . people fought .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
they divided the kingdom into two halves .
here &apos;s the aktualisierte version of this eintrags .
we can give ourselves something like that .
maybe we can see widrigkeiten as a change .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
this is about one percent of the population .
i remember my first fire .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
intersexualität comes in many different forms .
so we have this awful vereinfachende idea .
they had a concept of blue blood .
we see the same thing in the behindertenrechtsbewegung .
how do you diagnose people from their charaktereigenschaften ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
do we really want to go to that direction ?
we don &apos;t have these kinds of conditions .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
be just who you are .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
let &apos;s start with the sense .
it was in italy four and a half years ago .
it was when italy won to win .
and , in italy , it won at the end .
second of all the time . the end of the normal mind .
zidane , in a moment of kopfstoß .
we called it the digital water pavillion .
the roof was covered with water as well .
you can do that all the time .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
but the truth is far away .
this is the average size of a grönland-eisbergs .
and that was the outbreak of the act .
he can only use his eyes .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
this is something like our kampfschrei .
it all comes from our own pockets .
and i had to go out of town .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
he says , &quot; zum . &quot;
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
that made no sense in my eyes .
okay , you really want to know ?
i went to jail -- difficult .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
what would they say to ban ?
man 3 : i &apos;m the schmusetyp .
mann alkoholsüchtiger alkoholsüchtiger schreiberling .
you brought your pictures , yeah ?
i like things that are different .
the first one is a classic , apple .
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
are they achtsam and mondän like 007 ?
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
emc : &quot; welcome transparency &quot;
thank you , but the best thing is .
you can go very easily and rauszoomen .
but then you really want to go deep .
another lieblingsbild of mine , sternennacht .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
it &apos;s just too reasonable zeitpunkten votes .
the rest of the time is delokalisiert .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
also städtedesigner and -bauer are very interested .
they had different kinds of marmelade different types .
and i want to read to you that .
my fourth technology : assumption for complexity .
oh my god . oh my god .
actually , bear didn &apos;t want to make viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
even cats look at this video .
nobody needs to give your ideas green .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broke through the story .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
no apple has ever tasted again .
my mother suffered from alpträumen from the boat .
i was not familiar with the etikette .
there had to be another puzzlestück .
we had no a dime for a year .
we worked late to the night .
her father died shortly after her birth .
&quot; you don &apos;t have it visually . &quot;
secondly , x-ray photography should have the same beleuchtungsart .
the bank is from a different place .
we have all the navigationssysteme in our cars .
and sure , we can find fastfood-ketten .
today , i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
oh , my time is over ?
so there &apos;s a nice little dynamic dynamic .
and that worked . applause for scott .
scott unterhielt sich human beings .
beutelratte ? yes . life ? yap .
so each of them was a little different .
the zellengemeinschaften began to abstrahieren information .
it could happen in a period of time .
speichere the rest of it , the rest .
i tried to understand them .
with 16 , i started to illustrate books .
it can know where we are .
i learned this from my grandmother .
there &apos;s a few hochinteressante developments .
we have a lot of work going on .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
i think our identity is threatened .
we want something against death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of inmates .
i &apos;m getting tired of all of us .
he came up to me and umarmte .
i had written these crazy things .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
it was the fehlgeleitete kreuzzug against drugs .
but that &apos;s not the case .
child mortality has reduced to a tenth .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and we are increasing our expectations constantly .
now look at this curve .
notice two things about this curve .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
but the king of siam got aluminium-besteck .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silikate .
what will these three billion people bring ?
so , this was a problem for supercomputer .
do you know how to call a 400ter ?
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
and there &apos;s a lot of feedback to my oberarzt .
maybe i did it with good reason .
they breathe barely and was blue .
they switched to the beatmungsmaschine .
she didn &apos;t have suffered a behandelbaren gehirnschaden .
this is the kind of lehrreicher shame .
but i asked myself these questions .
why did i go to medicine ?
at one point i thought he would have nierensteine .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
i thought i could integrate myself .
if you do it , this is what happens .
the difference is then seen as a loss .
it can be a sequence of change .
that &apos;s largely our goal now .
so you don &apos;t often lose very immersive animals .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
but western governments are also helping themselves .
but today we are far beyond that .
we &apos;ve also brought littlebits to designschulen .
the ethnosphäre is the great legacy of humanity .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called nunavut .
every big picture is the beginning of a abschnitts .
or other models , or even technical specs .
übereinandergelagert up on the top of nasa &apos;s picture .
there are the ones that are much more räumlicher .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception reception here .
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else .
the official glaubenssatz of all western societies .
i just want to say a little bit about salatdressing .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
in other domains , the world of communication .
we erben no identity , we invent them .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
i could park directly before my house . &quot;
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
you &apos;re worried that we are getting worse .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask major questions .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
they laughed more than they did here .
so , this looks like a basketball-playoff .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it has a molekulargewicht of over 300 million .
it will offer a challenge for nine .
we take pictures of these mini-urknalle detectors .
it just didn &apos;t come , you know ?
oh , jesus , what a thought !
everybody knew that genius was paralyzed .
it would be the land on them .
if your job is dancing , it &apos;s tanze .
and if it doesn &apos;t , however , your dance .
it grows in the winter and collapsing in the summer .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
frosty , the kohlenmann will get clean every day .
this is one , one part of her .
saueber coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean kohletechnologie .
versorge america . find more out .
we have to get far , and that &apos;s fast .
and these interactive portraits are going to be true .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and slope .
this is our youngest beta-tester at the bottom right there .
now he &apos;s going to a tractor scene .
now i &apos;m going to do something about that .
i can change the sequence while it &apos;s happening .
i &apos;m delighted that i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
so , as i said , zweitausendacht it .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
now , if you think about it a little bit .
but i &apos;ll come to talk about that again .
and then the most fundamental thing is einflüsse cultures .
what &apos;s left us is the storytelling .
i want to explain a little bit about that .
and those two are also here today .
a key to natural user user interface .
to say , what is information ?
and on , now you see it always .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
and there &apos;s a central point there .
so , of course , we can look at the müllproblem .
this is going to be balanced in china a second .
because that &apos;s what it is for , right ?
have you ever seen a tree tree ?
we can support them , good to be good .
that means that the verbrechensraten is going back .
we can support them , good to be good .
and we see that it &apos;s very good .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
then i say , herzliches beileid , yes ?
but with the real design , please .
in two hours , they &apos;re growing up .
do you remember the windel ?
it &apos;s sort of a beneficial poop print .
and in my jugendlichkeit , i said .
the x-malige interpretation of a piece is this .
especially if he died .
it &apos;s an expression with his own breath .
this is what music is about our bodies .
because artists have a verhältnis relationship with lying .
because we cannot live without those lebenslüge .
a particularly beautiful story , like me .
so it &apos;s going to come from the outside to human beings .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any words about reality .
we can continue these things on different examples .
gleichgroße forces with gegensätzlichem vorzeigenzeichen vorzeigenzeichen each other .
and in berlin , there was a crazy ingenieurkollektiv .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
these were the very first calculations of six years ago .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we have 30 gigawatts photovoltaik in germany today .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violinkonzert .
it &apos;s hard to überbewerten the destruction .
he has a futterverwertung of 15 to one .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
look at your bäuche , pink .
every morning they fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
i mentioned it to miguel , and he nickte .
so , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
as a child , i drew comic books all the time .
i was obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
these blöden movies don &apos;t give us money .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
so what can we get out of all this ?
and also , the energiepreis for them is very important .
isn &apos;t that half or a quarter ? &quot;
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
the internet and services is a miracle .
and what do you do with the waste ?
the last three of the five i &apos;ve put together .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
there are lots of great books to this topic .
in the 16 sector , there are other innovative companies .
you hope that we don &apos;t need it .
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
they run the process , they understand it .
i thought , well , let &apos;s bring the pokereinsatz .
there was never a time like this .
my ur-großeltern died all as they were 60 .
my parents are the 80 on the fersen .
anybody even knows what that is ?
that &apos;s skandalös and we should be ashamed .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
the guy in the middle not so much .
and they &apos;re not just going to die at measles .
we had no kinderlähmung in this country yesterday .
did you all take your vitamins this morning ?
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo-industrie .
and i have all kinds of little detail here .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
they have them . they &apos;ve always got them .
and some of them worked , and some of them didn &apos;t work .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
-- that also the dosierungen play a role .
well , i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
people in the nebenräumen are now coming in .
well , the erinnernde self is a storyteller .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
thank you . i have a question to you .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
this is a portrait of the photographer phil toledano .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
this player is a short victory ago .
i don &apos;t get the real life of that feedback .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
players are masters in the spiders of social nets .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
what do you think happens next ?
antonyme : healthy , powerful , logical .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
and of course , it &apos;s made the click .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130.000 years .
it &apos;s a beautiful spärlich showgirl showgirl .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
it &apos;s not the test of survival and success .
in berkeley , we call these robots exoskelette .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
as i said , amanda is carrying our elegs .
he &apos;s picking up any fünkchen hope from my consciousness .
the dog ! i was lost by heart .
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressivität .
but bonobos give us the other side of the coin .
play is the kitt that beieinanderhält us .
look at what she does .
in other words , play is our anpassungsjoker .
so two pairs , every single baby , a baby .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to that .
they are in the back of our body .
he had an extreme form of an innate nebennierenrindenhyperblasie .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
they moved into a naturalistischen concept .
but how do you do that in practice ?
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
and i &apos;m going to wrap that up for you .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
so this is the reason for this project .
well , we introduced the mayor to the mayor .
here &apos;s how the building works .
i want to show you something here first .
it &apos;s at the same time , and it &apos;s a bewegungsaufnahme .
so they can sense the whole movement .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
as an artist , i &apos;m very interested in connection .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
make it possible -- you all here .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a geräuschloses plane .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bordpersonal .
i never want to move anything in life .
you probably knew the schuhgröße of the maschinenbedieners .
it looks like an old-fashioned assemblersprache .
so that made sense , it fit together .
so again , that fit really well together .
it &apos;s natanz and it &apos;s just natanz .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more dangerous .
so at this point , we need digital sicherheitssysteme .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
i worked in a kohlebergwerk -- dangerous .
no , that was what i thought .
it &apos;s unvorhersagbar -- like this strange landstraße .
i want to help you to calm down .
you want to tell me something about my brand .
all right , what &apos;s the brand gerry ?
i sell schmusetiere throughout the country , around the world .
tell me a little bit about this part .
we should put the bear in the cage .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite feature .
this would be somebody completely intuitive .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop . &quot;
so the theme of the day is : financial savings save .
well , who is ready for this journey .
because it doesn &apos;t feel that we really feel money .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzlestückchen .
but so many people got over the years .
life had not changed for centuries .
&quot; we didn &apos;t submit as a unwahr .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
when i say reality , i mean foto-realität .
and here &apos;s a very good piece of play .
it &apos;s got a button .
i &apos;m going to make my job work on 95 lbs .
next week , it &apos;s on the market .
we have herumgefragt , and nobody knew it .
it may take you to get charged .
al is a hydrant in boston .
today , a lot of people have given up government .
this is the call-center for service and information .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the beutelratten .
that our contribution to the system is choosing .
and we use this word with this contempt .
you could just show the slide .
all of those things were , they were aufzuteilen .
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
so the next step was happening within these communities .
so , we have the zeitskalen , again .
tell me , &quot; please this process . &quot;
now we &apos;re doing this with bohrern and machines .
they thought about being inspired by this .
it can know how we hold it .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
she had the last word in every familienstreit .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
i said , &quot; promised grandma . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , grandma . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
my grandfather was during the prohibition in prison .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
wealth , not verschulden , affects the result .
yet we seem to be very pleased with that .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
the death penalty in america defined by error .
an amazing fehlerquote . one of the nine innocent .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental abkopplung .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
it was always so inspiring , so beflügelnd .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the strafvollzugssystem .
i learned a few very simple things .
right , bryan , the judge has zauberkräfte .
polizeibeamte came in and stellvertretende staatsanwälte and office workers .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
56 percent of vergewaltigungsfälle don &apos;t come from court .
eight : eight : tsunamiwarnung . nine .
different speakers : drogenkrieg . massenvernichtungswaffen . tornado .
this is moore &apos;s law &apos;s law .
it slowed down for neither of our big problems .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
and we also saw this in mobile phones .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
and this is very important in the medizinforschung .
and this game was played by universitätsprofessoren and so on .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
well , really good , maybe a all-star .
and that was not a hard diagnostic diagnosis .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s doctor .
and i went back to work .
the three words loud : remember ?
i was shocked , and i was shocked .
and that was what i felt .
it was a lot off , and i was in a hurry .
it turned out he was a streptokokken-infektion .
he had potentially an potentially lebensgefährliche disease called epiglottitis .
this is the system we live in .
what you need is a new medical culture .
it supports when others speak of their mistakes .
i &apos;m a person . i make mistakes .
yet we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
they still describe as pristine as an astroturf .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
they get fewer , because we catch them .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
you can &apos;t get them wrong .
they only listen and start talking .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and the problem is not the technology .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
and we can navigate that very simple way .
if you want to create it , you want to make it between your pictures .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . thank you congratulations .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
but niederlassen is not always a bad thing .
their problem is they have too little .
you can &apos;t do it in this goldfischglas . &quot;
our steps at digitalisierung of life were exponentially .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built waterzeichen .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
we tried to get to the point of getting the automation .
this is not a elektronenmikroskopaufnahme es .
these are footage about a span of six seconds .
we &apos;re now focusing on renewables at the fourth generation .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
and they had to remove what we did .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
by the end of march , the lhc will be viable .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
i may have another 40 arbeitsjahre in me .
not just bad , but the worst ever ever .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
this is one of the most creative hybridization of a creative life .
and „ olé ! “ for you .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is 20 feet meereshöhe , like greenland .
there is a political argument in our country .
one of the commercials in the kohleindustrie around christmas was this .
frosty of the kohlenmann is a vergnügter , happy guy .
the most powerful bergarbeiter is the head of massey coal .
new investments to get paid together well .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
i &apos;m looking forward to all of you .
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself-bio closed dot , d.i.y.bio .
and that &apos;s where we worked with a code-of-conduct .
it virtualisieren the reality and it &apos;s not computers .
and in this mind , memory was a reminder .
fundamental tool tools have been jeher stories .
and they did this with so-called lead-landkarten .
which is , with the language language language , the language was rang .
we &apos;ve been moving in this way before .
another example is this so-called virtual reality .
anyway , you &apos;re going to do that in there .
and that &apos;s what we might like to look at now .
we understood that the weather is global .
so how do we work when we get there ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to recognize something from this pattern .
and sechzehn milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re thinking about from the wiege to wiege .
in the soil , over 60 percent of the land is stored .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re all in the vorwindelphase .
there is opec a bunch of waisenknaben .
because you know , this is a lustvoller process .
it &apos;s a form of revierverhalten , yes ?
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
but it &apos;s all in that is useful .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because they have changed twice the vorstandsvorsitzenden .
so , help me a little bit .
interpreten are the übersetzer notes in klingende music .
in fact , the notes are very vague and ungenau .
you collect information about the piece in the sekundärliteratur .
to keep zwiesprache , right with composers .
but maybe you can also even umstimmen them .
can you do it in blue ?
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
he &apos;s just holding it and not himself .
so , we can &apos;t really bear these things .
there &apos;s only the second best thing to do .
this is the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
the first two sentences that are logical are correct .
i can say the kanzlerin is a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any sense about what &apos;s true .
so if klaus says , there &apos;s no soul .
but it wasn &apos;t that much in the achtiziger years .
they have an renewables today of 15 percent .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go on again .
and then it looks like this .
our goal was just to say , okay .
that &apos;s what nobody did in the world .
and then they did a whole bunch of simulation .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and that &apos;s &quot; n short the message . &quot;
and in time , you can react again .
then we have to break down our must-run capacity in the net .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put .
let &apos;s call it miguel . actually , he &apos;s called miguel .
this is a fischaufzucht in the südwestlichen corner .
they did this by putting the land out .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
i grew up with a portion portion fiction fiction .
we &apos;re going to show it in the eröffnungssequenz of the movie .
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
i &apos;ve learned a lot of the time on this voyage .
i think first of all , it &apos;s curiosity .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
so , a climate change becomes terrible for them .
well , the energiepreis is like time .
this has to go down to zero .
the u.s. triebe for hundreds of years .
many people talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
the hauptproblem here is kind of like aids .
three feet is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
now they understood the vorteil of the prototyping .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
we &apos;re going to have a machine here .
but you know where you don &apos;t have right ?
they were just like the people in this room .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
this is a debatte debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
you know , there were no mandarinen in paradise .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
yeah , you &apos;re right . fix it .
you know , science is not a company .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
in the back , someone &apos;s sitting there who had no childhood .
i &apos;m really sorry . do she make it crazy ?
let me show you a little bit of that close .
i mean , this is a real cognitive device .
well , the self &apos;s life life itself is alive .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
that &apos;s not how it works at all for the sake of self .
the erlebende self has no voice in that choice .
we think about our future as a vorausgesehene memories .
which are the emotions that can be measured ?
there are other pleasures , but that &apos;s dominant .
well , your self is not going to be happier .
the more money you deserve , the more likely you do .
this is a problem that many players have .
that constant feedback is not in real life .
we &apos;re thinking about collaborative thinking , thank creatures .
you expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
what we want is to create the future .
so i say , let &apos;s start the weltverändernden games .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up the doors ?
see , dr. kean changed his thinking .
again , what &apos;s the potential we want to do now ?
the teachers didn &apos;t know something changed .
raise your hands . let me see .
how many would you choose for a good memory ?
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life of life .
and this is indeed a conservative estimate .
so , they go ; they &apos;ll save the shoes .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
but are we going to do the best of our spieltrieb ?
imagine just a moment ago .
we produce androgen and we &apos;re talking to androgene .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
i &apos;m a jessi , and this is my suitcase .
france does a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
that &apos;s something built in the city .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a rollenden iceberg .
on the left , you see a little boat .
tempt was one of the leading members of the &apos; 80s .
so they communicate -- they &apos;re walking along their fingers .
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
so they move around , and they make kunstinstallationen like this .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
now , there &apos;s all this rummel in front of the great unveiling .
and we have to make a lot of work on this device .
today i want to tell you about circles and snippets .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingbroke .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
it was something we knew .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
here &apos;s a clip from this angriffs- code code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
these results were achieved hard for several weeks .
the idea is to cheat a digital sicherheitssystem .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is generisch .
you could also use ordinary wurm- technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
so the driving force is the cyber- superpower .
i filmed in kriegsgebieten -- difficult and dangerous .
do you know how many people see these tedtalks ?
it was &quot; in eternity forever . &quot;
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer will be highly likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
not wanting to do something with the movie .
actually no , that was not the mistake at all .
and then we offer one of these great düfte .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
these are the people who form my worldview .
it &apos;s like i want to be .
there &apos;s a lot of kooks going on .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
he &apos;s not out of other countries .
you can look around all of these museums here .
you get to two because it &apos;s very simple .
i love this guy ; his expression is unbezahlbar .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is -- in a second .
but what if you want to see the pinselstriche ?
you go inside . you can actually go inside .
this is sternennacht , probably never seen before .
and that was a sense of humility to me .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side is not comfortable .
in the summer of 2009 , honduras honduras under a major verfassungskrise .
he asked octavio to be octavio .
this airport alone has a surface of 100 quadratkilometern .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and careful .
a typical wal-mart is now given to you 100,000 products .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
because the images made it real for them .
three things : tastemaker , teilnahmecommunities and the unexpected .
it was almost 200 million times a year .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being composed .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the besteck .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
my mom called me a few minutes later .
is it about the detail or colors ?
so i think the basics are very simple .
and let me show you a simple example .
and i see the same process in the process of combining images .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about combination of the combination of different images .
we know one more where all the gas stations are .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
he &apos;s typing &quot; beutelratte &quot; in the official database .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
because this is where the actual effect is happening .
we need to rely on the engines of government .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
these little öltröpfchen were in the sense of primitivste zellenform .
and try and do this again with another generation .
and i get a character in the book .
fireflies in a glass , i always found quite exciting .
and it &apos;s the way that it &apos;s done through the rest of the book .
it also shows itself in other places of the book .
at one point , the screen is filling up with leaves .
i thought , first of all , that would be a game .
we just alberten around there as well as it is .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in haftanstalten and in prison .
i think , in fact , have transformed our world fundamentally transformed .
in many areas , people had to be scared .
so these women , they were just meeting .
and i went over and i just listened .
wr people want to help people who were innocent .
i learned very simple things in my work .
and then i wonder , how could that happen ?
and i have to say , there was a force to me .
ten minutes later , the judge quit the judge .
bryan stevenson : well , there &apos;s all kinds of possibilities .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
so that &apos;s the dramatic high rates of prisoners .
recession . gridlock . doomsday . egypt . syria .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
so the amygdala is our early selves , our gefahrendetektor .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleons soldiers got silber-besteck , napoleon himself .
it &apos;s new nanotechnologien on the way , nano-materialien .
this is technologieunterstützte innovation that exists today .
what will they consume ? what will they want ?
i examined a woman , and she was in atemnot .
i hired them and made me the treatment .
i remember being as though it was yesterday .
both of those cases are nagten me .
some of my favorites happened in the last five years .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
you know , he was 1835 here .
he described one of them as a very common .
now it &apos;s on the red list of vulnerable species .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a loss .
the question is , why people accept this .
this is wladimir tsastsin from tartu in estonia .
somebody was hacked and had the system hack .
and that &apos;s what happened in the case of diginotar .
it &apos;s called the &quot; automatically stein stone . &quot;
a few years ago , i began to develop littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
and we want to make this material available for all of us .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
and the crucial irony is that extinction is extinction .
but the waorani didn &apos;t kill the spear with the spear .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you must protect it . &quot;
it &apos;s an independent area . you &apos;re all controlling .
this is a whole book , an example of nichtbild-daten .
and as possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange things .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
and we &apos;re reinventing ourselves as often as we want .
and the world we &apos;ve lived looked like this .
do you want the buttons or reißverschluss ? stone or acid ?
it &apos;s also my great life , loving love and fascination .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
in fact , he can feel really paranormal .
she said it would be like a donnernder train .
he finished all the shoes and did something completely new .
and all of a sudden , he did no longer in human .
and the proposal was to build a lot more kohlefabriken .
this is in our entire country of zweitgrösste abfallfluss of america .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
if we overdo it , we can do a little bit more zurückschütten .
here are some people who are testing it .
that &apos;s not supposed to be a joke at all .
now , what projects do we actually do ?
i think somehow six dollars or something like that .
so , i think it &apos;s a very gelungener hack .
and this is the kernanliegen of the biohackern .
that &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
how many doors has the house in which they live ?
the only thing that they had was their head .
and life lived in the küstenregion of british columbia .
that means you &apos;re navigierte about sound and rhythm .
we &apos;ve been used to things linear .
the whole thing is , i have to say that .
i &apos;m sorry that i need to bother .
i &apos;m also going to evaporate what is in there .
it was just as it used to be on the village .
and what does it look like in this ?
it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
i don &apos;t know who you know about this picture .
that &apos;s the time you fall in love .
so , like , a person with certain things like this .
we could just glide as a amorphe mollusken by weltmeere .
if we &apos;re in fact , we &apos;re not going to make phosphorus .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
that means the ants weigh much more than we do .
there &apos;s still a hundred billion trees in the office .
because the frankfurter facility could be best the phosphorus back .
we &apos;re seeing that phosphorus is really critical .
we &apos;ve now deployed us over three years now .
and the oil is going to be replaced with other fuel emissions .
no , that throw away exactly the right thing , yes ?
they can go around where they go and they stand .
in the countries where people are coming to money .
i can &apos;t play like this today in 20 years .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
and loud and leisezeichen , f and b , etc .
this is the hammerköpfe in the piano the sequel of my fingers .
the dauernde berieselung of music today is not förderlich .
so , i ask , how did fachlich competent was this diagnosis ?
whether the music is too sweet or too sweet .
that was the first start of a musical musical expression .
and at all , you &apos;re doing a lot less than me .
why do i have to do that &quot; n &quot; ?
and then , immediately , i &apos;m going to do that .
the spanish painter pablo picasso &apos;s once a woman .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
do that once and then you learn the sentence .
we actually know that something else is the case .
the soul is kind of intellectual , and about leibniz .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
because , in fact , this person is not interested in evidence .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
and then we started to negotiate with the insulanern .
have to negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve looked for new gesellschafter .
we can also aufschalten kilowatt kilowatt on the web .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of studies now .
this first one , it was more like a passionate thing .
i had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
these futterverwertung from 2.5 to one , he said .
&quot; 2.5 to one thing ? what do you feed ? &quot;
i was eating him at a restaurant in südspanien .
a journalistin journalist had been talking for a long time .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
i wasn &apos;t there at all a long time ago .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely selbsterneuernd .
so the pinker the belly , the better the system . &quot;
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
because when the water hits , it versinkt in the atlantic .
but for many people , this is a little bit radical .
this is not an interface , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
so i &apos;m going to step back and forth the perspective .
you do something that is actually a little different .
i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the world &apos;s top .
well , it &apos;s probably good to do with this science-fiction-rolle gepasst .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t make yourself yourself .
probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
the second factor is the services that we use .
i left tides tides , geothermal , fusion and biofuels .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
there are some innovations in the nuklearbereich ; modular , liquid , liquid .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
a very common wish , that we invent this technology .
where is the biggest interest , what &apos;s really going to do ?
this is a version of one thing that was made .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
specialized skills and prozessfähigkeiten and their combination lead to success .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and i took a while to figure out .
these were umsichtige people , educated people , decent people .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths through measles , 20 per hour .
he befreite us from one of the worst geißeln of humanity .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
they verdunkeln their urine . they do almost never .
so we run away , and where are we going ?
there was no weihnachtsbäume . we did all this .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
maniok is something that &apos;s going to eat half a billion people .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do .
i &apos;ll do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my breath .
probably many of you have seen this trick in the room .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo-effekt ?
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can do that .
the first of these falls is a widerstreben , complexities .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
it has moments of the erlebens , one after another .
most of you are being completely ignored by the erinnernden self .
the biggest difference between them is the deal of time .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
this is not how happy a person lives .
i mean , i rarely saw that flat lines .
now , we spend three billion hours per week on online-spielen .
ok , so think of the extreme selbstmotivierung .
this is the problem i try to solve .
and that &apos;s an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and these were actually the first of the people who developed spielgeräte .
likewise , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
that &apos;s a fascinating adventure that you go to .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global aussterbungs- , &quot; of course .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use a synonym-wörterbuch .
they teach them to open up the doors .
and it was also the same after the three months .
how would it be to live with good health ?
is it for others or care ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
our gut is a wonderful environment for these bacteria .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
so just imagine two other little changes .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known among the primates .
in most of my activities , i have two hüte .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are giving testosterone .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
in our observation , we get into all kinds of unbequemen areas .
we see that in all kinds of human life .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money in order to look great .
obviously it &apos;s not going to fit all of my tiny suitcase .
i have something that i &apos;d like to show you .
think of this as a bildpunkt , as flying bildpunkt .
this would be called , in ingenieurteams , a echtzeit-kontrollsystem .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just got .
but that &apos;s a lot of unnützer transporte and more complicated things .
did anybody see the movie &quot; fried and taucherglocke ? &quot;
it &apos;s called eyewriter and you can see the description .
since that time , we have all kinds of recognition .
the pilot introduced the machine after the hudson river .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i said , &quot; please flieg in the air . &quot;
and i &apos;m feiere , like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made a sense of me .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i want to tell you how we found this .
these zentrifugen in iran are divided in 15 times called .
and guess what we found in the angriffscode ?
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human being .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to make .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i don &apos;t know how empfänglich people will be .
how much money is needed to realize that ?
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with the project .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
so how exactly are we going to be judged in the movie ?
are you ? you see a little bit nervous .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
what about me ? what about the druchschittstypen ?
this is my brand in my little , verzerrten industry .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
a little bit more about you &apos;re not .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
a achtsame , verspielte brand . how is your brand ?
and how was that for you ? what good ?
this is just online -- no press , no television .
there isn &apos;t even online . no streaming .
finally , we should welcome the fear .
click , and wumms , you &apos;re in this museum .
this is the really cool part , which is called collections .
this is the gesandten &apos; gesandten .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
look , let me give you an analogy .
so quantum mechanics says that unbewegliche objects are just feeling .
we found that it was really weird .
so what i just tell you is what really fantastic .
there &apos;s more to that , it &apos;s deeper .
we are far away from that goal .
all parties , all the fraktionen of society , supported this .
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
it was a store that was called draeger .
this business , it was almost like a vergnügungspark .
they always worry that they &apos;re losing attention .
well , let me show you a little bit more about it .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
autofarben , außenfarbe of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
and this video was actually sent to january in january .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endlosschleife .
and all of this leads to a big question ...
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was completely excluded that it could fail .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i met the decision to pull in the u.s.
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
but you can combine something special like this .
for example , the fish had been recorded on a anglerausflug .
this is my favorite story . a very simple thing .
and over 10,000 million were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for it .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other regierungstechnologie .
so he got the citizens to test them .
and it &apos;s very gentle , of course , organic , of course .
but what happens to &quot; citizens connect &quot; is different .
it turned out the page . went home .
that &apos;s great . this is the digital digital .
let &apos;s call it the tierfänger , it costs a lot of money .
so if you could turn that light back up .
in fact , we &apos;re such a mehrzellige community .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
so today , evolution can happen in time of microseconds .
so in other words , i first define what i want .
so find programs which can sort of close numbers .
finally , i get the programs that can be pretty close to the numbers .
and yet we still don &apos;t understand the possibility of that .
the kid in me is really excited about this possibility .
you can tell things about the world &apos;s influence .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
she was also the starting point of a lot of people in our family .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also gay .
i remember that when it was yesterday .
i tried to say something about our justizsystem .
the united states today has the highest inhaftierungsrate in the world .
i &apos;ve been talking about some of the talks in germany .
he said , &quot; in germany there are no death penalty .
and i said , &quot; yes , very dear . &quot;
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to put injustice against injustice .
we want to eradicate lebenslängliche haftstrafen without bedingte for children .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story to end .
i had a 14jährigen , poor black boy as clients .
i went to the car and i was really overwhelmed .
we have hinreißen ourselves from the rhetoric of punishment .
and i think our current business is not helping anybody .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
i love this : &quot; watson bezwingt human enemy . &quot;
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
it &apos;s about knappen goods of goods .
so let &apos;s put these analogy into the future .
16 terawatt energy prasseln all 88 minutes on earth &apos;s surface .
he took a famous photo . how did it mean ?
there &apos;s a program that some might already know .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and the very time i was collecting more and more knowledge .
and when i left her , she made geräusche sounds .
i went home from the notfallabteilung to my way home .
if you do it , you never do the mistake again .
and she said the three words : remember ?
in a notfallschicht , i &apos;ve missed two times a blinddarmentzündung .
in both cases , operierte and it was fine .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of umgänglichen errors .
and at the end , you just want to get the erbärmlichen remains .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like that .
and the motives of online-kriminellen are very easy to understand .
in the future , most of the crime is going to play online .
that &apos;s where we &apos;re talking about diginotar .
now , how do people die in a hacks form such ?
but if you &apos;re in a foreign .
betonbausteine have been very fast the meistgenutzte baueinheit in the world .
essentially , the betonbaustein had become a building block of our time .
littlebits are electronic modules that have specific function .
but wait , this is really my lieblings-projekt .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
christianity , islam , buddhism , judaismus or whatever .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a e-buch .
there are a series of photographs here -- here are them .
they get a model that emerges from all around the earth .
and it was a consequence that the telephone was never broken .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
why do they advertise us when we can &apos;t buy ?
and the world we live in now are looking like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
this is what struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
clinical depression blew in the industrial world in the last generation .
a chromosome is just a piece of inertes chemical material .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
there are enzymes that are called the restriktionsenzyme that actually digest dna .
it verfärbte blue because of the genes we &apos;ve added .
in the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
these wires lead 13-tausend ampere when the machine runs on hochleistung .
and i don &apos;t expect that ever will change .
a remarkable statement that you can do about your work .
i &apos;d rather do that work that i love .
this is what led me to the old greece and the old rome .
the greeks called these divine diener-geister of creativity „ dämonen .
if your work floppte -- not entirely your fault , right ?
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
but even in my inbox , sometimes , i have this thing .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
so i started thinking , i should just einstampfen the project .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone from here to this .
in the andes , this glacier is the trinkwasserquelle for this city .
but if you &apos;re versiegen , most of your drinking water will be wegfallen .
so the alliance for climate change has two campaigns .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and also it smells good .
versorge america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
so when i put them side-by-side , that &apos;s what you &apos;re interested in .
most people know that from the softwarebereich .
and then i took a sahnespender and it &apos;s connected to it .
so i know some of those who don &apos;t agree .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
and the third area , actually explains by itself .
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god to virtualisieren .
and other examples are the ambienten , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
of course , what the storytelling is , of course , and it &apos;s a computer game .
but i &apos;ll just make it a little bit curious .
and , of course , design impacts influence the perception .
gestaltgesetz , near the continuity of the continuity and so on .
so that &apos;s where it comes back again .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve described the same thing .
and this is the projection of vision , rückkopplung , vision .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
that &apos;s the time of most perceptions that we have .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i want to encourage you to make a particular aspect of curiosity .
and because we become older , the nappies gets bigger .
here it says , the more you are , the better .
now , you &apos;ve heard about a little bit of a tree of trees ?
you can only have nullemissionen if you &apos;re not there .
even if they shoot now , they would have emissions .
because it &apos;s unfreundlich , to go and remove the nutrients .
that &apos;s natural , of course , but the facilities carry themselves .
these are sechsundzwanzig countries that control 40 percent of the ölvorräte .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you wegwirft the wrong stuff , you have a müllproblem .
if you run , yes , every footprint is destroying the ground .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
because we don &apos;t do the things that are more free .
as a interpretin , i just started the geschriebenen notes .
the notierten notes have the function of the letters of the letter .
the work of the interpreten starts kind of starts like a theaterregisseurs .
i play erklärend what these notes might have to mean .
i take the breath of the audience true or unconscious .
then the same thing happens in a good , angeregten conversation .
i &apos;m never going to play more like that at the moment .
i wonder , you know , often forget about something very elementares .
no longer needed to whistle , or singing it .
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so please listen when a music is played .
there was no piano at all as an instrument at all .
and also , what you would think in the mind today .
that &apos;s what loses half of his value in the first year .
and then rocks auftürmt , so he &apos;ll give you the point of view .
from this time , an anecdote that you might know .
the person is supposed to have abstammen or a common ancestor .
they feel that &apos;s the actual truth behind the origin .
this is what i want to show you two , maybe three examples .
he &apos;s very happy because he &apos;s fooled her .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum of a whole lot of ideas .
they were all used to be called kfa , which was called kfa .
because a good engineer built a great car , or atomkraftanlagen .
it comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and we can do that with this big battery two milliseconds .
and then you see what enormous geschwindigkeitsmöglichkeiten there is .
i understood that this is the nature of the art .
so you could feel like to sell it .
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to make sense .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love .
they grew fleischrinder on what was essentially the wetlands of the wetlands .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
the one farm , which is not feeding their animals ?
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensiv , not intense .
we &apos;re not realisten ; we &apos;re genießer . we &apos;re lover .
this is the one on two billion years of arbeitserfahrung .
because they are the ones who are experts for taste .
and i immediately see another pattern that makes .
you can test it for my talk in your backyard .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
so i can zoom in in a certain stage stage .
but i actually wanted to zum the real wreckage in the titanic .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
this wasn &apos;t a movie , no hd , that was real .
well , they were also hochtechnisch and more sophisticated planning .
so that &apos;s really umgeworfen , and i wanted more .
so the set was a very accurate copy of the ship &apos;s baupläne .
so my way of making movies completely changed .
you have to be prepared to take risks like this .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
people have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
it &apos;s renewables that are often called .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the target ?
the uranium is going to cost gradually , a little bit like a candle .
a nuklearreaktor , which provides a solution to the garbage .
the fact is that these uncertainty should be concerned with us .
and that &apos;s a pause that i think is appropriate .
they spend a lot of their time in the zusammenbau all the time .
konstrukteure recognize these kinds of collaboration as a core is a nucleus .
ceos are a little bit about average . but here it gets interesting .
this is what happened . not a team had a robust structure .
that &apos;s the same , bad team of one under the best .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my todeszahl .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about gentechnisch food .
ask , ask the evidence , demand evidence .
countless studies have been done to see if that was true .
myriad studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious thing .
does one in the audience ever see somebody who &apos;s dying ?
no fear , no qualen , kinderlähmung , pop , disappeared .
he &apos;s just developed a couple of other people &apos;s lives .
what about kinderlähmung ? let &apos;s do that . why not ?
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care system is 1.76 .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
and when i umdrehe , the fingers change its position .
i take this hand away . and here is the knife .
this trick you can run your friends and neighbors . thank you .
okay , so let me just give you a little blood for you .
i hope you &apos;ll be happy for that . thank you very much .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
and my talk today is mainly of these cognitive traps .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
these are actual patients that make a painful process .
from the point of view self , b had clearly a worse time .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
so you can ask : how happy is this self ?
we know something about the happiness of happiness .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
so if we were looking at how feelings are about income .
and this is what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
you never get a problem that you can &apos;t solve .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s 2,500 years of zurückliegt .
there &apos;s these ancient cube , from schafsknöcheln . you know ?
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready to play our own episches game .
and i can tell you , it was a change .
and i tend to see widrigkeiten as my shadow .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
or you want to be more powerful , more force , more force .
are we in a kind of evolutionäres equilibrium in the form of species ?
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hotelzimmertür .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
if you have to give something , you give it to it now .
and no , it &apos;s not burning , or san francisco .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the urwald of congo .
if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , games may be a game game game .
under a hat , i was working with the story of anatomy .
and as a general term , we can use the word intersexualität .
and the nebennieren represent androgene , which are virilisierende hormones .
if you &apos;re not moving , you &apos;ve buried it .
we &apos;re still finding other merkwürdigkeiten on what your rights is .
but a lot of people packed in a very strange position .
now in practice , people are not tested in their chromosome .
i mean , what does someone get with so many outfits ?
i brought seven underpants , and that &apos;s all .
and i &apos;d like to share with you this week for this week .
you can almost look almost great for less than 50 dollars .
if you &apos;re happy , you get happy people .
i smile , and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
and when we grow cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
you can see in the middle , the fluß , the fluß tiber .
now , we all know about where our stuff is coming from .
but we just know little about where things go .
she &apos;s creating something like a wasservorhang with bildpunkten water .
but in this night , it was a greater potential .
imagine that these bildpunkte could actually start flying .
we want to use that as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
you can move in and do different kinds of experiences .
they &apos;re interacting with their environment and their experiences .
as a iceberg melts , i atme its vorzeitliche atmosphere .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate ? &quot;
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
you go around the block and it was a revelation .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
i was the only one who could talk to the flugbegleitern .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given my ego room .
i don &apos;t have two years old with my wife .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
the idea behind the stuxnet computer-wurm is pretty simple .
so we should find out better what the target is .
they knew all kinds of bits and bytes that they had to attack .
now , in this area there are no thousands of targets .
and neither the maschinenführer , the sicherheitssystem , will notice .
he has nothing to do with zentrifugen , with urananreicherung .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the zielreichsten environments .
now this brand , the qualcomm stadion , the staples center ...
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of statten .
there are some places that we can turn to .
but that , what this picture is , is a problem .
you know , we currently hear a lot about transparency .
and the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever . &quot;
&apos; 80s revival is on skaterpunk , except on the waschtag .
and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburg .
why is it important , neuzustarten ? what is the red ?
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
we went to sao paulo , where außenwerbung was banned .
well , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
welcome the fear . welcome to the risk .
open the map , open it up with a click .
they &apos;re in there , they want to get up to the end of the gang .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
there &apos;s a lot more , but i don &apos;t have the time .
for instance , that would be someone who &apos;s completely logical .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
i don &apos;t see why that should be that way .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
they could try to expand the capacity of existing homes .
of course , each of these topics was out of many , many smaller decisions .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
we &apos;ve set up a little bit of a little verkostungsecke right on the entrance .
every single harvard staff automatically takes on a lebenszeitfond part .
we can do better with more categories than more choices .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
now there are 10,000 parodien of &quot; friday &quot; at youtube .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
what kind of drehbücher could you write in which kind of drinsteht ?

the biggest fear of pirates , they had rape and death .
the smells of the ladentüren came from the rest of the world .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell .
possibilities that would have not been allowed were explicitly encouraging .
three months later i was moved , and the adventure continued .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
pictures like this : a construction site along a much befahrenen road .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special images .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
you stimmst him to schaufeln when it schneit .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
it takes a few years into the rule of software .
and there are projects like this on any level of government .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if a neighbor helps the other , we will strengthen our communities .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
it &apos;s quite an amazing invention when you think about it .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
we see the process that &apos;s feeding itself .
but i really think it &apos;s something that comes out .
i &apos;m just going to go to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s &quot; put your finger on any light . &quot;
this is how you have to blow up the ipad and pour it in fireflies .

my grandmother was at the end of the day , and i was staring at it .
seven million people are released in the boxes or bedingter strafaussetzung .
but somehow we create it from this problem .
it was the fear of terror that shaped their lives .
and of course , it can never give you more . &quot;
vaclav havel , the great tschechische politician , once said .
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be tapferer .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
when someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so painful , so painful .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i looked at the janitors , and i started walking down .
that our survival is connected to every single survival .
and yet , 46 percent of all tötungsdelikte don &apos;t end with a verhaftung .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , they actually have a string of string theory .
i &apos;m a ladens death teacher .
four : bösartige kartelle . gefährliche kartelle .
six : social decline . 7 7 : 65 deaths .

the cost of solar energy was last year last year .
until 2020 , we go from two billion to five billion internetnutzer .
according to its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
we &apos;re talking about 300 , if a bat is beating 300 .
do you know how to call a 300ter in major baseball ?
this is somebody in the rest of the rest of the world .
and this is the message i put in medical school .
i even knew the differentialdiagnose to classify renale tubuläre azidose .
and i was fine , i was running with cum laude .
i sent them home without talking to my oberarzt .
and that was the first time i ever learned this myself .
he got intravenöse antibotica and recovered a few days later .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unumgänglich .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do the same thing .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know now that it was the bottom of the sea .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
because in the field of marine field , we actually make the past .
a long time ago , there was grauwale -- 500 years ago .
they also had to match a sheet with the beispieltext of this typewriter .
in these records , a folder called &quot; finfisher . &quot;
and within a few years , lego was moving into every household .
beyond the simple play , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
we &apos;ve got littlebits on kids and see them playing with it .
so , go ahead and start to invent .
the father of this young manns was identified as followers of the panchen lama .
that meant that he was killed in the chinese invasion immediately .
this is bleak house from dickens . every column is a chapter .
this is even live in the internet now . you can nachprüfen it .

we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it . ™ .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
there &apos;s a magical lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
and if we can , can we start this chromosome ?
you see in the upper field that its chromosome is just falling apart .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
on september 10 , the machine went on for the first time .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific world .
do you have no fear of killing the humiliation of a absage ?
with your chemiker-blockade , john -- how about this ?
please follow me , because the circle will end up .
so people in the west really thought about creativity for a long time .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to suggest is : why not ?
and i guess many of you have done that too .
i &apos;m looking at this as if i could just record a song ?
in california , there was a 40 percent reduction reduction in the sierra coast of the sierra .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
four times in the last 30 years like in the vorhergegangenen 75. .
oil is a problem , and coal is nevertheless the biggest biggest problem .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean kohlefabrik .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
it turns out he just wanted to stack up the siftables .
and i thought , i think , a very good code .
and i think technology is always becoming more important in our modern societies .
and then , under the schlagworten open , and the citizen science of science .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
and partly with these hackerspaces , they put together these places .
i &apos;d like to write four stichworte , and i &apos;d like to explain to you briefly .
and today , we &apos;re still very , very strong on stories .
that &apos;s a lot further back to the cultures in the world &apos;s cultures .
i brought them an example of the north african tribe of the north tribe .
what does it have to our thinking and our erinnerungsvermögen ?
and with a kind of a flashlight we can make these virtual worlds visible .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be with you .
but then just sukzessive that script as a primärmedium , got caught .
and these two worlds just pop together , new and old thinking .
but no longer at the local level , but on global level .
but also our perception , how does it make us .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting to see .
because everyone talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphor-problem .
so , for example , the environment , the environment drives less car .
so the question is , how do we deal with this diapers ?
so one of the proof of this is that men are not pigs .
you can only be klimaneutral , if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
and , first of all , is to ask what the right thing is .
all of what &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
the things that are used only are going to go in technical systems .
and i &apos;m not sure that they really are dabeibleiben .
so , in every store , you can put things together .
so , we don &apos;t need to be klimaneutral , we can be klimapositiv .
you study the works that he &apos;d done before and after .
how were the conditions that the society and the politics of politics ?
he asked me what the introduction of this ballade was for me .
when that happens , the student gets the nächstschwierige piece .
to sing our vocal chords , our hands and feet to dance .
and the melody comes from the gesungenen and the rhythm of the dance .
so a little bit of a bub , which is not interested in feuerlöschen .
this is now a dreisatz that tells us a logic .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
the first sentence is klaus , there &apos;s no soul .
and if i &apos;m right , the kanzlerin is a man .
if i don &apos;t know , the kanzlerin is not a man .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
the buridansche esel is a esel , which is made of pure nature .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack he should do first .
i spent 11 years working in collective , which was basisdemokratisch .
on this island , this is the island of graciosa .
yeah , this is what it looks like down there .
there &apos;s going to be a lot of widerständen and arguments .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
no , not because i &apos;m a selbstgerechter genießer and gutmensch .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentiniern .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
i asked him how to do it as a fisch-experten .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t feed your fish ? &quot;
it &apos;s the last defense before something goes into the body .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
and who sees these things are true in men , especially .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
so i decided to be when i was 15 .
and it was a experience that could not give me hollywood .
and i &apos;m flying with a little roboterfahrzeug of the ship through the ship .
we just play the cost of costs . none of the glory .
our imagination is a force that can even create reality .
and the approval of your team is more important than all of the world &apos;s lorbeer .
in the average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that reduce that in zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
normally , it &apos;s just the next time , and some of them come , not .
well , i asked myself , how can i get this really motivated ?
well , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
what we need is a lot of companies that are working on it . hundreds .
if we go back from there , what should that be like 2020 ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
usually most people are starting to orient themselves in the task .
so i offered a $ 50,000 piece of software for the winner .
and this is the value of this experience that &apos;s so simple practice .
and those of you who are interested in you can go to visit .
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a wunschdenken .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her kid against kinderlähmung . no way .
why ? because we don &apos;t have kinderlähmung . and you know what ?
echinacea , a little antioxidantium that helps you on the jumps .
well , i think i understand the drug industry .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
a deception becomes true , because somebody is aware of it .
but one white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
but it turned out that it &apos;s not all .
this is my skin . this is not a spezialeffekt of hollywood .
i know what people think when they see that .
this is really my skin . this is not a spezialeffekt of hollywood .
we &apos;re going to meet a couple of times in the next few days .
they were asked to tell all 60 seconds about their pain .
and what a story is , is a story of umbrüche , major moments and ends .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
and i don &apos;t mean just less , even though that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
how can we transfer these feelings to the reality ?
so the zusammenspielen enables that to grow from bonds , trust and with each other .
players love to be part of awe to be part of awe .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
we need to start transforming the real world into a game .
it &apos;s a online-spiel that you have to overcome .
and if you make it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred bucks . &quot;
we have a man who has value for our society .
ah , the majority . i like to be a doctor .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
if we &apos;re going to vorausblicken , these kinds of changes become increasingly possible .
this is actually the real heat of human and machine .
there are 68 million people who estimated in the world in a wheelchair .
he said , &quot; communism , you have to go to the house .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
so here &apos;s a young female and male in a verfolgungsspiel .
just that i think it &apos;s more like it , right ?
so sexspiele are common , both in bonobos as well as people .
to adapt to a unbeständige world , we have to play .
as a consequence , the body evolves more to the typical female course .
when the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
okay , just a quick example for a variant of intersexualität .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualismus .
and it makes me feel tense about consideration democracy .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened to the gründungsvätern .
and so they really prepared the future of the future civil rights movement .
so how do we ask the question of the properties of nature ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
this is what we call in our lab , wahrnehmbares design .
halbzeit , people make a short call , go to toilet .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
imagine that every single person is being run .
it &apos;s a physikalisches gebilde in london , but it &apos;s covered with bildpunkten .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
i &apos;m like , &quot; very archaisch , how can that be ? &quot;
every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes , or draw .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempts room .
so we have rejected his bed so that he can see outside .
that holds us on the shelf and we continue to develop .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s an amazing device .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve it .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
and that urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
almost like we prepare for our entire life .
i was introduced to the miracle of that day .
the gray boxes that you see here are echtzeit-kontrollsysteme .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
and in fact , this is the false forces of data from stuxnet before .
and if you &apos;re at risk , you can really do bad things .
and if you do that , you eventually get a cyber- massenvernichtungswaffe .
thank you for having us a heidenangst eingejagt . thank you ralph .
but again , it &apos;s a very good alternative opportunity .
and the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever . &quot;
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
and just that companies disappeared , one after the other .
so maybe you should have a little bit of this interview of this interview . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many grautöne and so on .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was ausliefere .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed an expert .
i have that . the first picture is a picture of my family .
i like things that are weird . i like things .
what is the machete ? what puppenstadium are you right now ?
it &apos;s actually a single time for two / 7 weeks .
every one big spoon , we &apos;re welcome the risk .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
if the museum gave us the picture , it click on it .
for example , this picture , for example , has about 10 billion bildpunkte , i think .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again in new york .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
this is where i &apos;m going to expand it . we look at the center right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side is .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to get all these extensions out .
in the meantime , i was preparing for a talk at tedglobal .
so i sat down , and you played the tedtalk .
and a new city includes new possibilities for executives .
my friends honduras me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many choices make you a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
50 percent of their decisions have been met within nine minutes or less .
they &apos;re making worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; stop . &quot;
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to assume gary &apos;s service .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; jazz . &quot;
you have to make 62 different decisions to make your car complete .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
when i start with the simple start , i &apos;m learning like myself .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video are uploaded every minute .
rebecca blacks &apos;s &quot; friday &quot; is one of the popular videos of the year .
we &apos;re not just going to be able to enjoy something .
i knew she had come to verabschieden .
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding it this morning , &quot; he said .
moreover , there &apos;s a mutter mother here in the fourth or five .
make it impossible to say how this photograph was actually made .
and yes , i have a problem , as you might recognize .
but where would the next aed be to help this patient ?
and she found that the city never frei the fire .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call bureaucracy .
it &apos;s not politically active ; it &apos;s actively active .
you have to introduce the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on semi-logarithmischen curves ?
and it &apos;s all the same stuff that uses exactly the same letter and the same code .
so the neurons are the informationsverarbeitungsapparat that they have built up these zellengemeinschaften .
so the invention of language , for example , was a small step in this direction .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the verbindungsmaschine .
now , all the übriggebliebenen that have the numbers that are best sortiert .
and this is with a method of rekombinierens , analog to reproduction . &quot;
because all of these new technologies of today are feeding themselves .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the dominant thing for me .
and we bring them back , in a more contemporary history for children .
in another chapter , you have to fotographieren a piece of baumrinde and tag .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
it would be gewissenlos from us , bewusst and gezielt people .
innovation , creativity , and development isn &apos;t just coming from our heads .
i vertrete these kids who were convicted of very hard strafen .
the judge looks at him as an adult , but i see a child .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the gerichtssaal ? &quot;
during the last three decades , the verbrechensrate in america has declined enormously .
this fact is often put into a relationship with the elevated economy .
well , in fact , the number of people have not changed very much .
the basis of a lot of these technologies , and these are growing technologies .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
because scarcity is kontextbezogen , and technology is a finite force .
in 2010 , we were living with two billion people online .
as it would be with a set of new , unprecedented voices .
how about beiträgen , which we can &apos;t even predict ?
i want to conclude with a story that really excites me .
we &apos;re close to the world cup and move towards the world cup .
that means that the player is safe for three out of 10 beats .
at that point at the time , i was accused of the kardiologischen service .
you say that you &apos;re never going to forget the names of the names .
i looked into the rachen and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
&quot; do you remember the patient with the gereizten rachen ? &quot;
and the fish was also fortunate to be there .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
this shows the vast amount of role that a marine reserve can play .
and the farbtöne and -schattierungen remember , &quot; avatar . &quot;
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in some way .
and this is one of the three hauptquellen of the existing online-problemen today .
mr. jain himself is on free feet , the aufenthaltsort is unknown .
diginotar is a vollmachtszertifikat from the netherlands -- or it was .
they had sold this program for 280.000 to the egyptian government .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , legos with this .
but there &apos;s a hauptunterschied : the transistor was just for experts .
the idea behind littlebits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
lights , sound , musical , motors -- everything should be available .
in 1957 , five missionare were trying to get together , and they made a schwerwiegenden mistake .
but at the same time , they had a clear sense of forests that was amazing .
it &apos;s not going to create distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new yorkers .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
this is a realistischerer case . this is a copy of the guardian .
and rick szeliski was done by microsoft &apos;s research , a very good collaboration .
but the spatial orientation of the images is actually meaning .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , who was recorded right .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress enables us to do .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
beautiful beach . great day . they all have it for themselves .
i couldn &apos;t make it better . i couldn &apos;t have myself niedergelassen .
these organisms can be totally dried , and they can even live in a vacuum .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
they &apos;ve recently seen corn ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
it wandelt co2 in methane to use the use of hydrogen as a source of hydrogen .
and by doing that , the wires took place slightly and 13-tausend widerstand resistance suddenly .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our great creative ones .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
be kept for your contribution , whatever it is .
i believe it and i feel that we should teach that .
in a sense , the arctic eiskappe is the beating heart of our global klimasystems .
and one reason is that this enormous heat warmer from the north .
this austrocknung in the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
the united states is one of the largest verschmutzer , together with china .
it &apos;s affordable and liebenswert , and workers stay in survivors and bread .
we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
versorge america : 100 percent cleaner electricity within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years .
you connect it with a particular tone , and it tends to be appropriate .
this actually has taken eight really , really , eight really , really , eight .
so the device you see there , that doesn &apos;t work .
the interesting thing is , if i can make a little trip .
still , we &apos;re a very , very stark act of being arrested .
and that &apos;s what i had last half a year .
so i tried to do that when i was , of course , or intuitively .
the next generation of graphischen benutzungsoberflächen works a lot more with behavior .
and the most important thing is to look at the soil as first .
we could , of course , reduce this by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
because the phosphorus is emitted by the pigs over the solid components .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , to be less harmful .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil where we get rid of nutrients .
right now , we can do it in this way , and we can zurückkriegen nutrients in agriculture .
so we don &apos;t have to have the people who are very good at least .
a woman in germany eats about six komma three kilograms during her lifetime .
that &apos;s why you help , ask for the people .
now there are lots of people working there , and they can all get engaged .
there are extra a club that can be mitmachen , where everybody can join .
the composer is becoming more and more like a friend of mine who lives together .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
you learn to find the notes on the side of the instrument .
now why do i challenge by my audience that it &apos;s also active ?
because the music is a language , and it &apos;s a language to communicate .
a piece of artwork that you never look at , has no force .
so they &apos;re going to be hörbar in the mind that they have only imagined .
i say , ulf , what do you need such &quot; n &quot; ?
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is gone .
you can also try that with words like revenge or gewinnsucht or diagnoses .
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a schönere .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s lady of worchester .
it likes to be particularly like it , because it &apos;s got a tendency to aufrichtigkeit .
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire fire .
although i &apos;m on the fire , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
i want to show you now what we found in my institute .
it &apos;s something that is not about backwards , universal nature .
so to lie that you can just use this logic wrong .
but the key is , when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
and now our täuschendes consciousness is immediately , it can do something .
this has to do with the fact that we go back into the vierzehnte century .
if you add more windkraft each other , the system begins to fail .
in the run , three of them are always waiting to be waiting .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green system is our system .
if you do that somewhere , it takes a long time .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t do what &apos;s sustainable proteins ? &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percentage of life is chicken ? &quot;
he came to the table with a bright , almost schimmernden white color .
so who can make a fish so good after he got verkocht ?
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that worked , not economically .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fischeiern to the birds .
oh , and by the way , these flamingos should not even be there .
it has evolved over the evolution of evolution to unreinheiten . &quot;
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical sterbediagramm after age .
and from here , i can go to the site and get it back again .
and we did that , and we managed to make a advantage for a while .
this is hugely important . it &apos;s a good piece of marketing . &quot;
and i noticed how much these tiefseetauchgänge , a weltraummission biography .
but i didn &apos;t know much about leadership before i got these expeditions .
no glory , no fault , no money . what are you doing ?
and we became a certain family for a period of four and a half years .
nasa has such a lieblingssatz : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
not an important endeavor , which provided innovation , has ever been addressed without risk .
co2 warms the planet , and the equation of co2 is actually quite clear .
it turns out that if you can get it to zero .
because even though he &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
you &apos;re going to say , you &apos;re nuts . that &apos;s good .
but as you talked to various people in the world about these possibilities .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for a lot later .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , as little unterstützt .
you get an anonymous administrator on the team , you &apos;ll significantly better .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high high school levels have a strong effect ?
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
so , we &apos;re talking about ironic , little quotes : &quot; progress . &quot;
and you can do that because you don &apos;t connect the cause and connection .
we love to simulate ourselves in lies . we love that .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
and that , although none of these are pharmazeutische -- it &apos;s just zuckerpillen .
if you take friendships , it &apos;s more effective than each form of shape .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
or , &quot; how did their journey go to albania to albania ? &quot;
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who has suffered more ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the erinnrung .
end , very , very important , and in this case , the end is dominierte .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
well , these are three weeks , and these are just a half a hour .
now the two ways of the self throw two terms of happiness .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is quite a complicated process .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
this is a player that stands on the edge of a so-called epischen sieges .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
here are the four things that i found . first of all .
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more überschwänglich .
we &apos;re putting games in order to escape in the real world .
they were playing a würfelspiel , and they were allowed to cause to be an adventure adventure .
she played 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute for the future .
and i hope they &apos;re going to play with me and play with me .
so again , change and customization are the greatest skills of human beings .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
and the a student will be tested harder , get better teachers and so on .
the very crucial thing about this study was that the teachers were not eingeweiht .
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
a few . probably about that as many of you have creative people here .
evolution priviligiert the creatures that adapt to their environment .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a verlockende , amazing and terrifying possibility .
wouldn &apos;t you want it to make these changes in your genes ?
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , whose numbers are multiplied .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the narrative in human evolution .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction also survive the bonobos &apos; survival .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
first of all , a ballspiel on bonobo-art -- and i don &apos;t think of fussball .
the secret is the game of the key to these skills .
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
we have two creatures , both in the middle of 1979 in the same day .
i get all my clothes from second hand on flohmärkten and in second-hand-shops .
what &apos;s interesting today is the echtzeit-kontrollsysteme is starting to appear in our lives .
well , that night , all of them went to celebration .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day .
and we got the commission to design a building in the expo .
you see the person who &apos;s going to be wondering what &apos;s inside .
on the left side , you see the bildpunkte , the different eingefangenen sensations .
and just like that , the iceberg gives you a different side of his personality .
my life is really extraordinarily blessed by working on some amazing projects .
so we have created a device that is completely free of constraints .
we put a projector on a wall against a wall against the hospital .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
i &apos;m glad that we never know each other as adults .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and this gave us a lot of confidence that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just that way .
and often we ran into a dead and we had to collect ourselves .
now , the idea of this is not just , obviously , the maschinenbediener in the control room .
we need to make the consequences , and we start to prepare ourselves .
so , despite that warning , i knew that anybody would buy the namensrechte .
these people will be connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
so , sir , you can help me ? i need help .
so , you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the actual version .
now i can answer all your questions , and give you a ausfühliche of frames .
what context is that to the thought and feelings about them ?
are you something that a little freaked out , reservierter , conservative ?
are they established , traditionally , pflegend , beschützend , compassionate like oprah ?
big data will transform for organizations around the world in great opportunities .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or so .
but at the same time , we need a good percentage to actually do experiments .
i remember seeing a child playing on a bodenschwelle .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
now , let &apos;s just trade up the construction of homes against the cities .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to our country &apos;s head ! &quot;
so we met in december sitzungssaal of a hotel in miami .
the other place that was very much interested in the urbanism is singapore .
a million people are leaving south america a year of latin america .
well , how good do you think you &apos;re going to do it ?
and we found that in fact there was a correlation .
you know , the average supermakrt today gives you 45,000 products .
every single one of you could be famous from the internet to next saturday .
because you &apos;re just doing that , you know , if you &apos;re in denial of yosemite mountain .
if you want to know , these other tips are also freitage .
it &apos;s a schuluniform to the knöcheln , because it had to cut six years .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
i looked through the duschtrennwand and looked at the other side .
to midnight midnight , he came up and he said he had to close the tornado .
yes , i &apos;m scared , scared , leichtigkeit .
so the first rule is that creationists should have the same perspective .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with me , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 follower on twitter .
and you can do that through methods like this , but also by crowdsourcing .
we know exactly where all the atm machines around the world are located .
so what did we do ? we did crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
how did he get to this particular kind of thing for help ?
they were there in february , and it &apos;s got a lot of geschneit last february .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and not even like a technik-unternehmen , but rather like the internet itself .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
they typically come out , when you get in your city town .
and we &apos;re not going to make government better until we improve the citizenship .
this is a slide that i picked up from my folder .
in other words , every step here is a power in the leistungsskala .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at on the zeitskala of life on earth .
this is also why the consistency grows to antibiotics .
we have a lot of cells that are not on their own .

the knife you can study ; my hand , which you can study .
i &apos;m going to take something that obviously is a deception , and let it look real .
you can see it right , but you can also see , if you want to .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we do it , telling stories .
well , this is a direct conflict between the erlebenden self and the erinnernden self .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we consume in this world .
well , the erinnernde self makes more than remembering and telling stories .
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given to the dominance of self .
if you &apos;re a happiness of happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing .
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .

these are decisions with which their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , need to be around .
so let me introduce you to now -- or the human universal load carrier .
one of the things that freundlichkeit kindness : someone had actually taken a pair of shoes .
women , like men , have something in our bodies , that you call adrenalindrüsen .
so we have this permanent anatomischen category that are in many ways and fragwürdig .
if all of the answers , i feel like i won .
unterhosen for exactly one week , everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
they are 75 percent of the energiekonsums -- cause 80 percent of co2 emissions .
and that changes radically the interaction that we humans have with our environment .
now , today , our environment is beginning to answer us .
and if we &apos;re going to show that to people , then we can move forward .
imagine that anyone can give a little donation for a bildpunkt .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come as a scientist .
imagine a big explosion , as they go up on 1,000 feet .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on 1d .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with windows-software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
it &apos;s basically running out of the buschehr nuclear and urananreicherungsanlage on the urananreicherungsanlage .
we need digital sicherheitssysteme where a human maschinenbediener can &apos;t react fast enough .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
i think that the mossad is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so this is the whole concept , all the film , from the beginning to end .
and i would love to be very pleased to do this .
but is it a difficult thing because of the movie or a difficult thing for me ?
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .

you don &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
you put it in a up-attribut ? are you a little bit that blood gets in wallungen ?
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
i went close , and i realized slowly , that these kids actually put something together .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two camps .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
he was a kleinkind , not very good at it , and he was constantly falling .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the big day-to-day objects around us .
so i made this thing in a similar way that you make a computer chip .
what does it mean for an object to vibrate at the same time and not vibrate ?
just for about 12 percent of their decisions , they took an hour or more of their time .
today , i want to talk about one of the biggest entscheidungsprobleme of our modern time , the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem .
well , before we started today , i had a conversation with gary .
here , for example , is a study that we did in a zeitschriftengang .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
just like &quot; double rainbow &quot; it seems to be from nowhere .
well , tosh.0 gabelte it started to write a lot of blogs about it .
it &apos;s important that creativity , which is in the internetkultur of techies and geeks .
imagine the first piece : a man that burns his work .
the next puzzleteil show , like a boat in the early days , is quiet on lake ausläuft .
like most of the adults on the boat , my mother had a little giftflasche .
so i spoke about jugendarbeitslosigkeit and education , and the vernachlässigung of the marginalisierten and entrechteten .
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s the women .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i &apos;m still thinking about the boat .
because , of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
photographs where you have to think a brief moment to figure out the trick .
it &apos;s not about what is realistic , but what we think is realistic .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic gesundheits-projekte failed failed .
there &apos;s going to be a little blutdruck-messgerät that you &apos;re going to do with an iphone or something like that .
and my little startup would like us to protect ourselves by protecting it .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;m going to just skip the video .
so he did what any good engineers would do , he wrote an app .
it has an app , an app and handy-app , &quot; citizens connect . &quot;
a second-class citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
so this neigten , to survive , to survive , and it divided into grösserem extent .
and the veranlagten these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
so as an example , the raffinierteste we know about this kommunikationsart is human language .
we say , &quot; computers , generiere request a hundred million randomly sequenzen sequences .
but one of the ones that might be lucky with a little bit of a little bit of order in the right order .
we know that a entwicklungsprozess is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silberne taschenuhr .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped her way of seeing a lot .
and she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me only three things , bryan . &quot;
i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise . &quot;
i had whatever , your sister had what . go ahead and a beer .
he said , &quot; grandma tells all the grandchildren that they are special . &quot;
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what our actions have in the historical context .
but think of a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we do that . so we &apos;re also so rational , so we have intellect .
she said , &quot; and what will you do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
we need to have ways to confront these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discussing .
even though aluminum 8,3 percent of the erdmasse , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal .
and if we have a energieüberschuss , we will have water in abundance .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
but now the biggest force that leads us to a world of abundance .
and after two , three days , it was realized that she would never erwachen again .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they managed to be the geschehenen .
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
as you can see , the lagoon was surrounded by palmen and a few mangroves .
my third little story tells me about the introduction of schleppnetzfischerei in southeast asia .
and within a year , you have a survey , and then you start with the commercial fishing .
there &apos;s a little bit of fish left , and we think that &apos;s the normwert .
they found an article with falschem gedankengut , they could find the creator of this thought .
the second largest angreifergruppe we see today are not motivated by money .
these are the questions that we have to deal with over the next 50 years .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wires .
add this to an extra effect for another effect , and they &apos;ve made a lärmmaschine .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique sound of the liedes , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
the interesting thing is the metaphor which defines the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
the suffering of tibets can be intolerable , but the erlösende spirit of people &apos;s mind .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species existed for 600,000 years .
the gleitschienen of her sled were originally made of fish that was made in karibu-haut .
this is a project called photosynth , which actually connects two different technologies together .
you know , i &apos;ve never thought i was going to work at microsoft &apos;s end .
we have now almost an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
should i get married later ? should i have kids , or do i have a career ? &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to do something bad about it .
you really want to make the decision right , if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
when they came in 100 species , it would be perfect , one of them should be perfect .
and that leads to less satisfaction with the results , even though the results are good .
if you break it down , so that everything is down , you lower happiness .
does it allow the chemistry to create this really large molecule that has never been done before ?
it actually took a couple of years off with a bioethischen review before we did the first experiments .
the viral particles were then launched by the cells and came back and killing e. coli .
recently i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they were doing this model right now .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the lichtmikroskop .
the elektronikindustrie had a dozen components , and look at the diversity of it .
but right now , we &apos;re working on doing the same approach for developing vaccines .
in one of the connections between neuntausend magnets in the lhc , there was a manufakturdefekt .
the entstellt and verzerrt all the egos and it creates all these unerreichbaren expectations of success .
maybe an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative return .
if you want to know what the sea level is going to grow up , you know , it &apos;s going down here in the sea sea .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security is .
there &apos;s an old african saying : &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
so here i am -- this is a series that i &apos;m going to create with a very simple sketch .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle .
it &apos;s a story with open ends , and he can decide how to evolve .
and finally , i can ausblenden the whole sequence by expanding the lautstärke-siftable .
so , it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , so .
but always always the idea that it should just be accessible and accessible .
and what are our values and what are our principles , our foundations ?
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
they don &apos;t have any lead-landkarten , but they &apos;ve been used to gennanten , or traumpfade .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from the top to b ?
it &apos;s happened , and it happens to be the book and happens , and happens to be the book .
it sounds very spacig , and it sounds very like science fiction , i know .
so you can explain that much better , because there &apos;s more much more behind it .
many use of the word , but don &apos;t even know what it means then .
it &apos;s important for the gestalter , the most important semester , the great gestaltgesetze .
so , first of all , sound very banal , but it &apos;s very exciting when you get closer to it .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually just going to be seen .
there &apos;s a lot of practical functions , so it &apos;s sort of formale things , or formalästhetische aspects .
that &apos;s a lot more powerful , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
that means we &apos;re losing about five thousand times more than neu .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that would really have to go back into circulation .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
in every place , where you get , you know , , you know , you &apos;re going to lebensmöglichkeiten .
and it contains seeds from rare plants so that you can throw away through the biodiversity .
a television or a washing machine , they use it , they don &apos;t use them .
i said yes , you know , it &apos;s about the same as long as spoken language .
well , you can see , in all cases , nobody has to be a candidate candidate .
or what i &apos;m thinking about today , because what you might have thought about .
why don &apos;t we have to know that people are achieving something when it is true ?
but we know when we say that , the social biases are extremely sensitive .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that should work .
so we &apos;re supposed to think of them as something that is necessarily supposed to present to our lives .
so the second sentence is , if klaus is right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , who is dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and i brought to you a project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can only do that , of course , if you &apos;re wired in some way .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s happened with a normal , stinknormalen battery .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild the society .
and that means we said , first of all , to find the greatest battery in the world .
it &apos;s not , it &apos;s schwachsinn , it &apos;s kinderspielkram , we have all gerechnet , never .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a autarkes system .
and the reality of that speech is all about us , and it &apos;s moved , inspired by us .
in the last 50 years , we have die the ocean as we have bare kahl kahl .
well , he mentioned some algae , and some fischmehle , and then he said , hühnchen-pellets .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds .
well last year on this site , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species .
he said , &quot; no . they do that because the food is better . &quot;
now , i want to do this idea a little bit further about what a little bit crazy .
so , the summary is a very short picture , and a symbol of the area that you come from .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
so we went in &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next movie , much further .
so i shifted that , and i did this other movie on the big ship , which is falling .
and the preparation of that was enormous . we had to build cameras and stuff and stuff .
because at a certain point i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do here ?
so i asked the question several times , &quot; do we really need to get down to zero ?
it includes everything that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
usually there is no deadline that you need a miracle to a certain date .
but in this case , we have to give a miracle and get a miracle in very short time .
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that &apos;s going to get the idea of people here ?
i decided that it would be a freilassen contribution to the environment of fireflies .
well , there are all kinds of spielereilösungen like this , but they &apos;re all not doing much .
let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels , burning by either coal or natural gas .
one is the energy energy that makes these technologies dramatically lower than the kraftwerken .
instead of breaking your head , you simply burn it . a great thing .
if countries are meeting in places like koppenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
klimaskeptiker : do you have one or two sentences to convince you maybe ?
they talk about how it &apos;s going to look like what it &apos;s going to look like .
and that is that bwl-studenten were trained to find a real plan , ok !
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
if anyone built a 2,5cm high construction , he would have worn the price home .
and the basale lesson , i think , is actually a verbindender sport .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a adventurers .
it &apos;s because opportunities are not going back on the planet , they go forward .
i think we can power this world with energy that you don &apos;t actually breathe at the same time .
it &apos;s not happening in this country at all , but 160.000 times in the world last year .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing to us and seelentötend ourselves , who can afford it .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this verrottete stuff , like maniok .
but that &apos;s not what it &apos;s all about , and then i open my hand .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and so that was an amazing thing for me .
and people at the back say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that . &quot;
and then he added , really , quite emotional , which has ruined the whole experience .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one themselves .
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life itself ?
just to give you an idea of the relationship , the correlation is about .5 .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
i &apos;ve calculated that it &apos;s going to play time at 21 billion hours a week .
oh , you know that . ok . fine . so we have some players here .
that &apos;s me , as i am in life , i &apos;m bad .
why is it impossible to think , you can &apos;t just achieve anything ?
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
the second zweitgrößte of the world , with almost 80,000 einträgen , is the world of warcraft .
we work with universities all over sub-saharan africa and shop to learn to learn social discourse .
and he called this part of his kurses , the x factor , the potential of the human being .
we are zweigen from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
it &apos;s warm ; it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s feucht , it &apos;s very comfortable .
they &apos;re helping by the verdauung nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
now , when i was a neuling on college , i had my first biologiekurse .
but at the time , as a mehrzelligen organisms , things started to change .
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
of course , this leads to some major complications -- rückenverletzungen , 30 percent -- chronic rückenverletzungen .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the human race .
they live in the deep part of the kongolesischen , and they &apos;re just difficult to get them up .
that could be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; it puts it in the eggs . &quot;
i worked with people with zwergenwuchs -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one had anything .
now mind , i mind , i want to maintain certain trennungen , literally seen in our culture .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been gezeugt at the beginning of the talk .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
feminism is about gender klischees about gender , so feminism is nothing female .
it &apos;s almost physiologisch impossible to be bad , if you wear hellrote pants .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then they won the race .
our cities were brought together in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it is .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
they say that all things are going to be shown up there , a life cycle .
so we &apos;re going to figure out how to do it better , faster and stronger .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
and then he said three words -- the emotionslosesten words i &apos;ve ever heard .
because when the wine is , and the person is there , then i open it .
while we were fatal , i had this feeling , man , to die .
so we don &apos;t need to worry that others could be met by stuxnet .
so , for example , he would work as well -- in a power station or in a automobilfabrik .
there &apos;s only one and this is the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand herausforderer .
how can we keep them more fresh -- fresh fresh fresh fresh water , three times more fresh .
i think if you keep people out of it , you get them to fail .
we have to encourage people to have no fear of opportunity that they might be verängstigen .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and its access .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
so i &apos;m now in front of one of my favorites , erntearbeiter from pieter breugel in the met .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get 10 billion bildpunkte ? &quot;
and what only , if you want to see van gogh this masterpiece because of that masterpiece ?
and this is a great model of the world , so long you don &apos;t have a teilchenphysiker .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
so if you think about it basically , it &apos;s where we are today .
you already have a baugrundstück ; you &apos;re going to think about this area for the second city .
one of the things you already know , it &apos;s been geklärt , there &apos;s a lot of mieter .
or even building from these cities , or are hundreds of verteilt around the world ?
and after that , we looked at what people were doing rather a glass of glass .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it comes to our own best interests .
and if their employees can &apos;t auseinanderhalten them , they can &apos;t do their customers . &quot;
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order of the order that make decisions .
who could have predicted &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; nyan cat &quot; ?
two strümpfe for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
in one thing , i was the classic east student , the unerbittliche demands of himself .
and i was katapultiert by a puzzlestück , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
at the end of each pair , i cooked a huge topf soup that we shared .
but if i could give this to you , and you might be sure , i would do it .
we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
but what they really do is to show what &apos;s possible today with technology .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami-sirenen work , but people steal the batteries .
if you know about regierungstechnologie , you know , it &apos;s usually not that way .
but on &quot; citizens , &quot; everything is public , so everyone can see it .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bureaucracy sexy .
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice as granted .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the government &apos;s work .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosionsartigen curve .
and she makes it part of the way that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
the poor apsaras were stuck in indras chambers in an old muffigen book .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then ask online .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to connect the world and the technology .
you have to do the sound of the winds , and read the rest of the book .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up to me and she sat down .
it was something that was made , you know , that you wanted to be near .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . only do you . just do it . &quot;
he said , &quot; well , what about you ? well , what do you do ? &quot;
and she believed that these are the issues that we have to care about .
in green and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
and here in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population is permanently lost .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
i talk about race and the question , whether we have the right to kill .
and after the terrorism , of course , they came up , of course , and decades of rassistisch motivated motivated employees and apartheid .
if you take something that doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s not just a pathogen .
and to my horror , i didn &apos;t just write him , but sent it to the court .
most of the masseninhaftierungen in this country was not really in the class of the gewaltverbrechen .
and the old saying , &quot; if it &apos;s blutet , the demand is very true . &quot;
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always going to be bad .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibms supercomputer watson in the risk ?
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
i gave her their aspirin . i gave her medicine to take the heart from the heart .
and he knew it , he would have been able to get more information to her beizusteuern .
so i unterzeichnete the entlassungspapiere and an ambulance and rettungsassistenten and brought it home .
i ordnete in order to rehydrieren him and asked my colleagues as well .
and you know the leier about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work later in africa .
90 percent of our fangs were sponges , other animals that are connected to the bottom .
if you &apos;re in a kriminalfall verdächtigt , you &apos;ll be able to angezapft your phone .
for those nicht-ingenieure , a more material material , electronics was just another material .
when each of you in this room was born in this room , there were 6,000 languages spoken .
but what makes it interesting is that this live relationship between the living and the dead .
deshab likes to say , &quot; your white goes to church and i &apos;m talking about god .
this plant has a lot of very strong tryptamine that the serotonin , dimethyltryptamin-5 and methoxydimethyltryptamin are very similar .
you can only be put in relation to some other chemicals that mao denaturieren .
so these are all flickr-bilder , and they &apos;re all in relation to that kind of relationship .
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b , the benefits and risks .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this , a study about investment in volunteers .
he &apos;s making a point of life now , and perhaps things slow to do things .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi 174 .
we made little pieces , made a fehlerkorrektur and a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the fehlerrate at a mistake was a $ 10,000 base per 10,000 base .
think about it : we have a 4-buchstaben code : a , c , g and t.
the chromosome that was in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve put in .
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 of this material growing in the atmosphere .
we &apos;re entering the edge of the biological reality of the biological reality and to those of our notions .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
maybe we can &apos;t erase the gedankengut of 500 years of rational humanismus in a 18-minütigen talk .

so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
you &apos;d want to cut down far lower , kegelig , blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a problem of modern , rich , western societies .

if we can do this , then this past datenfalle , maybe a new source of information is sinnvoller .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the boundaries of possible .
certainly , i would never get an alien world with a spaceship , which seemed quite unlikely .
the nature of nature doesn &apos;t know any boundaries , unlike our own , kläglichen human imagination .
in &quot; abyss , &quot; i was able to connect my arteries and connect to the filmemachen .
what came out of that was the first computergenerierte ever to see in a movie .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s back to the fact that your imagination can create reality .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same as if i was in a science-fiction-film .

and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their schulaufgaben underneath the straßenlicht .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .

the challenge offers a common experience , a common language , or a grundhaltung , to build the right prototype .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics who were nuts with me didn &apos;t get angry at all .

what would you do , which you delay because you think you &apos;re always there ?
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart from this code .
so , it was possible to allow us to put the little digital sprengkopf with the rotorsteuerung .
the rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
so , for example , the number one is very different from that code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
so we may sell a shoe , and he &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever worn ...
now , who knows when the film comes out , we might see a little bit of a horde .

the more opportunities they have available to them , the more they put their entire money into pure geldmarktkonten .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to fix it .
here &apos;s a german autohersteller who gives you the opportunity to konfigurieren your car completely .
last year sendete bear vasquez , this video he had filmed his house in yosemite national national park .
this chart shows how it was , as the video last summer became popular for the first time .
because tastemaker wie , like jimmy kimmel , make us new and interesting things , and show them a big audience .
michael j. nelson from the mystery science of science was a first one that made a joke on twitter .
with a gefangennahme , i only had my sister and i , you know , and i &apos;d drink my grandmother .

i just duschte in a hotel hotel in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
and these two images are erfüllen these two demands -- the same altitude and the same level .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced to the radboud-universität was to make a haupt-zuhörer .
the program is called &quot; for america for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like friedenscorps for geeks .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it .
i &apos;m talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
this is because the government is like a moving ocean , and politics is the top one .
this could be a fire fire , unkraut a trash store , a trash store .
is that really , then it means we &apos;re in the middle of a transition right now .
now i want to talk about what that might be , that transition in which we are right now .
we &apos;re as far as we can only write , even to the vergnügungszweck , in this code .
and they developed special structures that made nothing else , as information within the organism .
the first steps of history , which i told you , is a billion years per piece .
and i think we are all part of the creation of what &apos;s going to happen next .
i thought it was like our fancy clocks and cameras started dreaming about it .
it &apos;s also important to me to create something that indisch is also very zeitgemäß .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m gestehe that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
a politics of fear and anger convinced us that these problems aren &apos;t our problems .
and because it is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that has to respect law .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
in my 15-year-old , i explained that error is the staatsanwaltschaft and the police and the police .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
during the break in the break , there was a polizeibeamter that the janitors were störte .
that we &apos;re not fully designed as human beings , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and grundwerte .
it sortiert and durchkämmt all the information on the search for all of the andeutung in our environment .
the president of coca-cola has just begun to launch a large test-projekt with a hundred units in developing countries .
but before i get to the actual issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
in high school , i &apos;ve been told that brian goldmann was going to learn for a bluttest .
on the neuten day , she liesen her -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
both of these are strong untertreibungen because we don &apos;t look at the problem as we should .
but i &apos;m bedaure , though , but i &apos;m trying to learn best from it to pass it to others .
i was driving on it and we did it all the southern sea , and especially in the south atlantic sea .
we fit our normwerte to the new level , and we don &apos;t call ourselves in touch with what was there .
at the time , we &apos;re focusing on the big animals and the sea is the big fish .
here , i think , i think the art and the film may fill the gap , and simulation .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , can meet only with hope .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are , and what we &apos;re doing is an amazing wissbegierige species of view .
and then you would suddenly see how it would be , if you couldn &apos;t talk to your own language .
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , you get out of the mind . how can you get hurt ?
now , that doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count than it is .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the ethnosphäre . it &apos;s power . it &apos;s ugly face .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all the rest of the world .
all these pictures are connected , and it creates something larger than the sum of the parts .
we can put together 6.5 million different varieties of plants from the components that are offered in this one store .
and what it does is it causes people to walk into the business and ask that question .
with so many options that you can choose , people are very hard to choose to decide .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , it &apos;s never coming .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
i &apos;m quite sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time in which the choice of our common lives .
we managed to get it to about a hundred genes of the 500 or something that are here .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could put these pieces together and correct the mistakes .
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
and even those who don &apos;t actually have to be begingen , seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how they get taken into the next century .
but in the old greece and rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
but then i remembered how tom had talked to the free sky , and i tried .
and i want to say to record that i &apos;m here for my part of the job here . “ .
when this happened then , people knew what this was . they called it .
what i have to say to myself is when i get mad about it , is : don &apos;t fear .
an interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
i &apos;ve just got to step back a little bit , and it &apos;s just a little bit busy with modern molecular biology .
it &apos;s extremely important , now it &apos;s extremely important , and much more important is going to be in the future .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and you need biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
and then you can accelerate the particles strong enough and then put it in the onion .
so that , as a second-class citizen , you know , it &apos;s going to be versetzt by these scientific technologies .
you may know , if you &apos;re interested in this , from the australian u.s. indians .
and we have the linearity as a law , and there are just exceptions , like for example .
we had the vogt -zeitalter , we had the maschinenzeitalter and we &apos;re now going to go to this so-called cyber-zeitalter .
but these concepts of the design process that bring us back to us to discover these possibilities again .
and this project , i &apos;ve brought to this project , as an example , of how back to this archaischen , cognitive models .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re dealing with next to the actual experience as a creator .
because often people are coming , they can &apos;t do it , so they can &apos;t do it .
you &apos;re trying to do it as well as the subject of perception , the subject of perception .
and it &apos;s an assumption that they have an assumption on the front , that they see something that they recognize .
back to my actual topic of natural user interface , and the subject , of course , which is also dahinterliegt , is usability .
i can use that directly or i need &quot; n manual , &quot; or i need a entsprechende training .
suddenly , i think that the appearance of success is just a strategy .
that &apos;s not exactly what science is about , because because we don &apos;t know how much weggeküsst is going to be done .
you think of this time in time by looking at contemporary images or reading literature .
our organism has invented a great way of making such unpleasant feelings like envy just to disappear .
i want to explain to you this mechanism today , or reflect something to you , which is probably familiar with you .
yeah , you feel it if you &apos;re heiter at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
and what we can now read almost every day in the daily daily newspaper , you find this third sentence .
the energiehunger of the world , which is going to be stattfindet with diesel , because you don &apos;t need permission .
here we see this again again , again , again , the diesel , again , again , all the aggregate .
then they &apos;re only using what &apos;s in the sun and the wind is where they live .
and while i was playing , i realized that in nathaniels eyes , there was a complete change .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and part &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
it turns out that miguel is the largest part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding .
and that &apos;s because in the mittelbereich here , people are largely active and they &apos;re over here on the gebrechlichsten .
now what we have here are the titelbilder of every single category , which has ever been printed .
now , if i look here , i see the athlete that appear in this copy and the sportarten .
our intent was to look at the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
and this is what animals look like right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in weltraumwissenschaft , which was back to the science-fiction-einfluss of my childhood .
but in the art and in exploration , failure must fail to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a vertrauensvorschuss .
and there are certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
these are very good things , and armutsverringerung means making these services almost accessible to every one on the planet .
you told me that you don &apos;t bite . you don &apos;t even leave the glass .
and if you &apos;re cheap and filtriert , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
well , let &apos;s go to the destination that we need to reach , and then we talk about the zwischenschritt .
a few years ago , at ted , at ted , peter skillman a design-wettbewerb called &quot; the marshmallow-herausforderung . &quot;
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design-workshop .
as we told peter , they didn &apos;t just tell the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
and why ? because you &apos;re understanding triangles and sich-selbst-verstärkende geometric geometric patterns , the key to build robust structures .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , the robust structures .
they geformt the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of scientific method .
people are manipulating themselves in their faith , and that &apos;s so tightly that you can &apos;t free them .
we are at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a projector .
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we can keep from our experience .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they were suffering ? &quot;
that &apos;s going to lead to the patient , but only a little bit less than before .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted the person is when this person thinks about their life .
so in the past few years , we started learning about happiness in the two types of self .
is this something that you can share with us , because you have a few minutes left ?
60,000 dollars a year are people unhappy , and they become increasingly miserable , the poorer they become .
people are wondering that they should be aware of happiness if they think about politics .
so i looked at games like world of warcraft that provides the ideal environment for collaborative problems .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to finish their epic mission .
so many people are now in the world who spend at least an hour with online-spielen .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players , which are pretty good in whatever .
so i started thinking about what it is that these games are doing to master .
there was such a large famine that the king of lydien decided to be a crazy idea .
and geologists found evidence of a global abkühlung that took almost 20 years , which could explain the famine .
but if you are in an adventure adventure and say , &quot; we &apos;re going to get the oil . &quot;
the point of view is computation , that people have only 23 years on the planet .
and in particular , the last two words , i &apos;m the last two words under &quot; near antonyms &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
just a human being , as a child , to say , could be able to einzuschränken and give you beliefs .
they didn &apos;t think of these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone is dealing with it , are two different things .
so this is also the unterhaltungswert of this talk , so i hope , d ate it .
evolution is all over the copying of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
in the good way , in evil , and as you might think , these decisions are going to be about us .
but not only that -- so they connect and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and increase my strength and resilience .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility .
if i don &apos;t get rid of poverty , i think of as a gehilfe of a volunteer at a volunteer löschzug .
this is just a small vorgeschmack on the insights , the bonobos give us our past and present .
in this case , i worked with people who have körpertypen , the social norms in question .
so , for example , i worked with people who are the twins twins , two people in a body .
and as a consequence , his genitalien male was coming up , his brain was exposed to typischeren male .
some people with xx chromosomes , develop something called ovotestis , which is called eierstockgewebe umhüllt .
for example , we &apos;re entering the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
we find men in the marschierenden mountains of bürgerechtsbewegung , saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
again , people of different skin colors that have anatomische differences in anatomische differences , again , successful .
well , just to finish , i want to note that i talked a lot about the fathers .
second-hand-shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my garderobe on the environment and also to my purse .
the next day , everybody went to the center of the siegerteam and the prime minister at the same time .
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in zaragoza , spain .
no , you didn &apos;t kill the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
and this is the beautiful thing to create things that are used and interact with people .
you can have a kind of flexiblen screen or display , like these -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first icebergs .
and then one day , he came back from walking back and said , &quot; paps , my legs . &quot;
i met with his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
more than anything , everything else is my single goal to be a good father .
i got another gift , which is to see the future , and come back to life and to live .
it might be , for example , for example , an american american power station , or a chemieanlage in germany .
so after the first thing we were looking at first , systemfunktions- aufrufe , because we know what to do .
the big digital sprengkopf -- we got a glimpse of looking very closely at data and looking at data .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- it &apos;s really aus me out of socks .
and so the film is going to examine this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i thought , &quot; well , put the camera out of &quot; would mean that we wanted to make a difference .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone is doing under the achseln .
i think the genre , the style i have , is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
let me just tell you a little bit about how that is connected to your thoughts and emotions .
in the entire city for five years , there &apos;s no anzeigentafel , no poster , no flyer , nothing .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s going on with the $ 50,000 7100 ?
and so i started playing around , and i realized there &apos;s something going on there .
just to give you a clue , i think that you can see what you get .
i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and have a talk to the fourth and a fifth january .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of category in one hour ?
and he showed up the busladungen of tourists that came every day and usually had their cameras .
from the people who were left when they were 24 , they just bought three percent of them .
in the plans that were offered almost 60 fund , the teilnahmerate now dropped around the sechzigsten .
they drive the decision -- push them , even if it &apos;s against their own best .
those who really want to make a choice will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
the only thing that i &apos;ve done is to change the sequence of this information .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re choosing choice .
today , we want to talk about how video videos are going to be , and then that &apos;s why it &apos;s important at all .
again , only one tiny percentage will ever be viral and will look at thousands of times and look at the cultural moment .
and the next puzzlestück is about four women in three generations , which together build a new life .
we went down to footscray feet , one of the arbeiterklasse vorort vorort , whose population made of immigrantenschichten .
my mother worked on farms , then on a line belt in a autofabrik , six days , twice .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
and yet , my interest in photography when i got my first digital camera , at age 15 years old .
and if you make good pictures , the result can be quite beautiful , and pretty realistic .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited is our imagination .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you through a short video .
we had a team last year of fellows in boston to the code for america .
and sure , we would have these fire fires all the time , and many people do that .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is what &apos;s going on in the way here .
so in other words , the future has shrunk every year since i was on this planet .
and every time it divided , it turns out to be able to get chemicals into more unequal quantities .
so the nervous system has the evolutionsprozess with this particular informationsstrukturen because the evolution could now happen within an individual .
and what we actually did , we actually , is we &apos;ve started to abstrahieren .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian epos mahabharata . &quot;
she became a goldener access to a world full of pirates and verunglückter ships and images in my imagination .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into natural world with technology .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
i call my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the end of the rekonstruktion , until the beginning of the second world war ii .

and i met in my little dachstube in the sisters in the sisters , the european hospital , unweit from here .
i gave her medicine that we call diuretics , water pills , so she ausschied the fluid .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there were no mängel in their treatment .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he was in the right lower sector , he called the operateure .
we have a cognitive mistake , so that we can take a perfect krankheitsverlauf for a patient with a patient with pain pain .
the fischgründe of these buntbarsche were very ertragreich and the fishermen were doing well , and they were doing more well in ghana .
the biggest part of the fish , the small dots there on the rubble , the trümmerhaufen , were korallenriff-fische .
because obviously , an animal that has been very often , once again , before it ausstirbt .
how about the arab spring and things that are happening in egypt ?
in the same year in the same year , the next year , the next year , the next one revolution .
and just like the biosphere has been stark , it happened with the ethnosphäre -- just even greater speed .

instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you , we could do a do or we could make b .
and what she found was a 10 percent of the employer of the employer , took the participation around two percent .
and the more ways that we get to choice , the more attractive qualities of these choices are going to be considered into the oppertunitätskosten .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations than there was only in one way .
the secret to the glücklichkeit -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all got -- the secret to glücklichkeit are low expectations .
and so , the bilanzergebnis is that it &apos;s generally better to us , objective , and we feel worse .
verarmten imagination , a kurzsichtige view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i thought that the fish knows something .
but the abhanden is a metaphor of a metaphor , a recipe for misery , and , i suspect , disaster .
we found in the resequenzieren 30 mistakes . if we had the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radiodurans of the three million rads of radiation .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space and moving around , looking for aquatischen conditions .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to get the process a little further .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30-plus billion drums of oil . these are 100 million drums a day .
so at minus 271 , cooler than the space between the stars , these wires can sustain the tension .
the result is , i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i &apos;m going to fall off the fall .
the question i want everybody to ask today is this idea for you , ok ?
the artist &apos;s artist was protected by certain things , like , for example , too much narzissmus , right ?

and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be recorded songs .
i &apos;ve been asked for a moment of time if this is a sprechender , and i &apos;m going to talk to you instead .
so a very , very , very spannender process , like doing things , and what &apos;s going on to happen for these things .
once i saw that , that &apos;s a dalmatiner inside , you know that .
but i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s a entsprechende for us , and also to make certain things .
it &apos;s used every one of us and osit , and it &apos;s an acronym and orientieren , informieren , informieren , transagieren .
i &apos;m going to talk about it now , practically , this whole umweltdiskussion , weltuntergang , 40 years of club-of-rome , in quality .
so that &apos;s how i would say , if i say , you know , your child is just going three times more than five times .
you &apos;ve done bruchlos civilization over five years , because you &apos;ve always been able to zurückzubringen nutrients .

with time , you also have judgment , and you want to get a little bit more spices out there , or taste some kind of cute differences .
so when i come back , with my little unveiling w , and i &apos;m looking next to me , this feeling .
then this awkward feeling disappears , and it may not even tell you , and it &apos;s always going to give you more and more similar .
we don &apos;t just have the art of art , but in the science of science , but in science such as great lies .
we have to prevent people from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so , just like this , we &apos;re going to use these words that we use in the language of politically korrekten .
and when we &apos;re in frankfurt , i remember , i remember the max-planck-institut for hirnforschung .
immediately , you &apos;re going to be there for granted , of course , that you can &apos;t prove that .
and the power-utility , which is the elektrizitätsversorgungsunternehmen on the island , that &apos;s what we find quite great .
over here , we &apos;re designing all the übertragungsleitungsystem , the kilometer-physik of the cable to actually represent the schwingungsverhalten in the net .
that is , if you &apos;re at 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do it without storage .
if you don &apos;t have that , this spinning mass , you have to replace it with leistungselektronik and elektrochemie .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million förderprojekte now , and we have a deutsche to the german net now .
he said , &quot; yeah , feathers , skin , knochenmehl , boom , reste and food . &quot;

a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of krasser inequalities in the distribution , not the gesamtproduktion .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single one of them , and they reduced a little summary .
so here we see a very basic service . can there be light at home so that you can read the homework ?

you &apos;ve heard about &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + a strength &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + intelligence .
up until today , all the world &apos;s population has spent 5,93 million years trying to solve virtual problems .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one outcome . players are super-mächtige , hopeful individuals .
and the only problem is they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
a person who has opened doors to me was my pediatrician at the a.i. dupont institute in delaware .

now look at what happened that day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
all the children from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they played with the building was quite different .
it could have an impulse to have a momentum that comes from people , from the movements of people or whatever .
so the idea is that we actually engage people with them in which they do things together .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to the top , like london &apos;s new berggipfel .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated from nature and that everything is connected .
it starts with the marines , then the schimpfwörter , then the bush-verleumdungen and the final people are actually doing art .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at high school at high school , ohio , where i was the klassenschwuchtel .
and i should mention that i have bauspeicheldrüsenkrebs , and i want you to come up . &quot;
while i was thinking about it later , a saying was a saying , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
the nutzdaten are going to be in the gray box , it &apos;s damage to the centrifuge and iran , and the iranian kernenergie-programm verzögert .
stuxnet was like a laborratte , which didn &apos;t like our cheese -- schnüffelte , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
and when we were experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to see that this is a gezielter attack .
so , in the large and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have , which is the goal .
so it &apos;s just as much as in hollywoodfilmen , where the verfolgungsjagd is fed , where it &apos;s killed by aufgenommenem videoaufnahmen .

a lot of spaßiger negotiations and stories that i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click this way away .
i think finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from google .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re just going to do this digital medium of art , and they represent it online .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little , tiny particles .
so , imagine that you would be at the same time in a couple of places like that ?
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more valuable than building it .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , as much more valuable as they are .
this is a picture of a big new city , which is built in south korea , which is a great place in south korea .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that people offered something between two to 59 different fund .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem is to address the problem .
the other half of the customers goes from the low possibilities , four gears , to 56 autofarben , many possibilities .
there was a meeting on reconciliation and a quiet voice , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
she reminded me that i was now as old as she did when we climbed the boat .
and even though i graduated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t appear with a career in law .
she grew up to a time when the social norm and the local mandarin was the most important person .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
so for me , photography seemed to be more about being the right place at the right time .
and yes , i even have the house on the top of the island in red to let it look 99 .
and i think the most important thing is that we stopped talking to our patients .
make ways that are easy to use and start to hug patients in the team .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to get the verstopften gullys .
it was about a method that parents could find out what the right public schools are for their children .
and as many people , i thought that it was mostly about choosing people in office .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we all fight , which is , who can speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic s-kurve like this , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .

let &apos;s say i want to close numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for that already .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever been able to write .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be put in a single murmel .
we &apos;ve all heard of feen and nymphen , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , who are apsaras ?
and sometimes when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and strength that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .

the united states of america is the only country in the world , dreizehnjährige children to death in prison .
in south africa , people understood that the rassentrennung is not to overcome the response to truth and reconciliation .
if we don &apos;t engage with these difficult issues , the positive ones are also affected and wonderful .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can anticipate the evolution .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i started at ted a new university called singularity university .
but then technology was developed , and then made aluminiumherstellung so cheap that we use it with our wegwerf-mentalität .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet on a planet with more energy than we consume a year .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the abundance of no one ever predicted .
i &apos;m going to give you a statistics of that i hope most of you have heard .
imagine if you have a blinddarmentzündung , and you &apos;re going to adopt a operateur , which is a durchschnittsleistung that is 400 in terms of 400 times .
other medical doctors fear that , but the notfallmedizin is very , very special because we just see the patient so flüchtig .
if i had a room -- like now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
and this was an example , in which our own governments , in terms of our own governments , use the citizens .
the first betonblocksteine was made 1868 and entstammten of a simple idea : modules from cement with festgelegten measures that fit .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
lego has basically the betonbaustein , the building structure of the world , and made a building block for our imagination .
as the betonblock , the transistor allows us to build much more complex , more complex signals , a rock after the other .
instead of coding , you need to program , or you need to code , you allow them to interact with simple , intuitive gestures .
i grew up in the woods of britisch columbia and believed that these forests are there to become gerodet .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this area .
the answer is : you &apos;re looking at the doctor &apos;s closest morning and asking a change in the prescription .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
oppertunitätskosten reduces happiness , which we get through our choices , even if what we chose is fantastic .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , these digital information is really accurate .
triplets of these letters -- these letters , about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so people who think of evolution as a gene will have changed a lot from biology at a time .
and it &apos;s only nurmale selection . we can go to lebensfähigkeit , production of chemicals , or treibstoffproduktion , and so on .
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not got the reputation of alkoholsüchtigen manisch-depressive people .
by socrates , it &apos;s known that he thought he had a dämon that he made out of his way away .
in these opportunities , the poem came in and intact in the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
he just looked in the sky and he said , &quot; excuse me , can &apos;t you see that i drive car ? “ .
more importantly , are you physically , why you can only move your hands through your hands and access .
so i think we &apos;re in the middle of the world , and i think it &apos;s actually a step further than the academic world .
he then came up with this this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum , it went .
now we think our love depends on stories that we have as a child on the lap of our parents .
and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce , which we produce , with the real world .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing .
so a lot of natural , a lot of natural , but i &apos;m sort of looking at where it is salt and pepper .
and then , on the left , you know , you can access , and i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in it , which is the salt of salt .
i &apos;m going to get the whole set of equipment , now , filter this up , and can say , show me just all of the things about chocolate .

if you go to that way , where you think and magic evidence and science , you can get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and durchsticht itself , just to give us the skin , just for a few minutes . &quot;
they don &apos;t care , because he was verblieben with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep .

this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , where we are better in play than in real life .
we trust that somebody will spend time with us that the rules are going to be eingehalten , that we have the same goal , and to stay in the end of it .
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
and imagine that i &apos;ve even been negotiating as a child &apos;s child with dr. p. , and so trying to stop this practice , natürllich without success .

and while we &apos;re talking about bacteria , you know , is that every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than the cells in the rest of our body ?
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that is not just natural , but led and decided to do it as a individuen. in the decisions that we do .
play is a formwandler , and it can take a lot of forms , which some of which are close to some kind of quiet , phantasievoll , curious -- maybe to find the surprising again .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact , and the unexpected verknüpfungen that we are forming are the real nährboden of creativity .
i want you to imagine two pairs in the middle of 1979 , in exactly the same day , in exactly the same moment , every single day , a baby -- okay .
what she was doing was a anatomisches concept , and they were replacing it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .

well , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;re programmed , we went to the strandpromenade in venice , my kids were involved , and we created this .
about three or four years ago , i received a call in the middle of the night , a woman who said , &quot; i have to see them .
now , if we can do that , the systems that control and the valves and the valves , we can actually create a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
and i called them up and zapfte their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotors , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor and finally , finally , to explode the centrifuge .
so the idea is to show that brands are a part of life , actually , to get them to fund the film ?
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; point of view , &quot; because that has an negatives -- but you know how this will develop ?
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth it , some really familiar , some really familiar brands .
and i think , &quot; free &quot; is a great word that these categories really do something positive , as opposed to &quot; fighting smell and humidity . &quot;
well , there are verspielte brands and achtsame brands , these things that come and go , but a verspielte , achtsame brand is a pretty strong thing .
that means that every atoms at the same time is at two different places , which is that the entire piece of metal is on two different places .
but you could go to a completely new place , built a new machine , vorausgesetzt the laws would be able to build such a form and not get rid of it .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even kids who are trying to find their parents trying to find their parents , in some cases , since a decade .
so what is it for an idea that is that every family has a choice between a number of cities that are in competition for new residents ?
and now i give you a couple of seconds to read them and ask them to clap , when they &apos;re ready to take up gary &apos;s .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not on the radweg , but there &apos;s a lot of disability that i can &apos;t get a lot of interest in the radweg .

when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in the year 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , then they give us a pretty good picture about how they do it .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and make something very complicated in the heads of others .
and it all connects us to something that is much bigger , and it can also continue to evolve faster than we &apos;ve been .
i know and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job because you get out of a series of hunderttausenden programs that have done the job .
we bring our children and we get into the natural world and to the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
she took me out and she said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to promise that you don &apos;t . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old , rural south and i have a brother that &apos;s older , and a year younger sister .

and every year we ask the students to create companies , products and services and services that can influence the lives of billions of people .
and then your pupils , you get caught in front of your head , then you look down and relax , and you &apos;re starting to tell your stories .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
we want the world of creators , the inventor , the mitwirkenden , because this world , in which we live , this interactive world , belongs to us .
now there are some of us that kind of forget that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of the self , &quot; really different possibilities of his own .
this is a people who don &apos;t distinguish cognitively between the colors and green , because the himmelszelt the forest of the forest that people depend on .
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 different varieties of ayahuasca that you all recognize at large distance in the forest that seem to be a way .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one , for example , is a scan of the kongressbibliothek and it &apos;s in a domain of 300 megapixeln .
and this is something that is using the complexity , with the people using it , growing and using the user to use the user .
when people have freedom , each of us is to do the things that our common good will maximize and nobody has to decide for us .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether this means to do all the tasks that i &apos;m going to share with you and not get good grade in my class .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inerte chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
and i have argued that we may be able to create a new form of kambrischen explosion in which it could be massive new artenbildung based on this digital design .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to get the fact that we reach beyond our limitations is the value of things like the lhc .
and what &apos;s going on with the creative project is that they make us insecure about the corresponding quality of life -- in a way that they don &apos;t do other jobs ?
this is brilliant -- there is , there &apos;s the distance , which i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from your work .
that &apos;s kind of sad for the hackerszene , because that &apos;s not true what it actually has really begun to do , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
another thing from the united states , which is just to do with this vaterschaftstestgeschichte , is that it &apos;s the p.c.r , which is complicated , complicated word .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s still in a framework where it &apos;s clearly available .
and if you can also make useful decisions in society , and empower people , you want to know , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and those of these assets that make the virtual reality reality , they have needed the people in the vorindustriellen times , because they had nothing to do .
and as you can see , this is a very inselreiches area , and you had to navigate there , from island to island to get food .
that means that instead of remembering us , we have standardized , far common , common patterns of memories of memories that we can depend on .
it &apos;s direct ads , not for the company , puma , but for that they &apos;re now helping this company to make these products successful .
it was on a klavierkursus for musikstudenten in my beloved old teachers , professor jürgen ude , a well-known beethoven-spezialist , konzertpianist , konzertpianist and long professor of musikhochschule here in stuttgart .

this one of these verweis , that in the heart of the bub , knew that it &apos;s actually related to the fire , but it can &apos;t tell you that .
and if you have this premise of eyes , you understand the logic that we &apos;re experiencing this happiness through a lie through a lie .
it looks something like this , who doesn &apos;t have a willensfreiheit , can &apos;t be pulled for its actions and claims , and it &apos;s therefore unzurechnungsfähig .
and yes , a lot of what was told today , i &apos;m very , very happy , because many , many beautiful statements that i &apos;ve also lived in .
how big would you have to be such a battery so that you have an island in 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance in the moment , you have to switch off the diesel .
that our system also has a preisanstieg , because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with diesel , and we don &apos;t have a preissteigerung on the other things .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years in the last 30 years .
we came to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , where nathaniel was interested in geigenunterricht for me .
now , after i chose government , i know that the wikipediakategorien , the most of the time , the most of the time that you see most of the year is &quot; people of the year . &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you just look at it by looking at websites in this way , and that can look at all the way around the same way .
but the messlatte got very back , and people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t able to be able to do that .
she made a conscious sense of this telepräsenz-erlebnis that you could use such roboterhafte and so that you can get your consciousness into the vehicle , in these other forms of existence .

now , the exact correlation between a co2-anstieg and the dadurch temperaturveränderung and where the other consequences are , there &apos;s some of the myths , but not very many .
the terrapower-konzept means that instead of a part of the urans , one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
we should use the effektivitätsmaßnahmen to get reducing reduction on the road . the less we &apos;re going to be the lower , the less likely to be the temperature .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can do it for 60 years -- think of a column -- that you &apos;re buried without all the complexities .
bill , i think i &apos;m going to talk for almost all the people here , when i say , i &apos;m really hoping that your wish is going to be true . thank you very much .
the average majority for most of the time is to create hälfte , for example , half of it , the lawyers slightly more , but not much , much better than the adults .
drinking water , urbares land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and that &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t disappear , and if we don &apos;t disappear from that chaos .
now , what i hear all the time : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monokultur , we don &apos;t want to have huge areas with one thing that is wrong .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
as you can get happiness , it can be very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the self , or whether you think about yourself .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that we &apos;re going to show people , after playing with them , even when they have defeated us .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the old greek historikers , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people that we love to do , to preserve them , but they &apos;re also ready to get good to it .
you &apos;ve got to separate two things : to be the medical fact , to be the medical fact , and for the other people who think about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
but they also have a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to increasing challenges , by more creativity and druch cooperation .
so gender is really complicated . intersexuelle are not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be spread across the whole range .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in ways that they think and act in the world .
and since they &apos;ve heard me from me as the woman who &apos;s running here at ted in her underwear -- that means i found a few things .
we found one for them , we took them , and we took them around , and we took on their family , because it needed to be necessary .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , in terms of the windows- part , the dropper- part , and he made of unzähligen day- day- of failures .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the dropper of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the nutzdaten are a science for themselves .
and i spent 30 days doing that , nothing to eat this -- spaßig at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the center .
what i want to do is make a film about product placement , marketing and advertising , where all the film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every single time that we talked about , the customer that we had to do .
so the first case : all the trillionen of atoms that are the piece of metal are still there , and at the same time , the same atoms move up and down .
so if a single atom can be at the same time at two different places , that piece of metal can be two different places , why don &apos;t you ?
i loved to go to that business , but at one time i &apos;ve asked myself , well , how does it come from ?
it also puts me in excitement about the great product i &apos;m zusammenstelle , and so i &apos;m willing to be willing to be with interest .
it &apos;s not very scientifically scientific -- she &apos;s making a cup of coffee or tea , and the patients , family , family , related , &quot; how are you ?
and you could have been able to connect them to government successes if they had to have that , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to state services .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like so many other people we find in our field , are a kind of a semi-logarithmischen curve .
telefonie , computers , videobänder , cd-roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to sustain this information .
and then she said , &quot; oh , next to me , that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot;
it became silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible to kill us again for the systematic of people .

and when i was with her chest chest abhörte , i could hear a knackendes sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering from heart failure .
and then on a bewölkten day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun came out , and i might be able to feel better again .
and i went back to the same kind of tortur of shame and self-doubt , and i kept up , and went to work to work until it comes back and again and again .
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear anyone about your own mistakes .

the american intelligence agency in front of the year two months ago from mr. sam jain here , and on this account were 14,9 million dollars , when it became frozen .
well , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
the sioux-indianer weren &apos;t listening to the sioux , when they were bogen and arrow , when americans stopped being americans when they stopped being horse and pferdewagen tasks .
and even though you &apos;re all off , every minute we &apos;re asking our child in the kindle of a fußballspiels , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i embrace this call ?
the reason for that , i felt worse with all of these possibilities , my expectations of what a good pair of jeans , went up .
you know , i &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects before the human genome and what that means , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
we &apos;re finding all sorts of species here that have a second chromosome or a third of irgendwoher , every time thousands of characteristics in just a second of a second .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu , and we &apos;re always a year in the back , and we &apos;re having a dollar in the back of the vaccine .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and we &apos;re going to be able to collect the data in june or july , and we &apos;re going to end our journey , to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a kind of a spark of accidents , again , again , the debate about the value of science and engineering , it &apos;s easy to do something like that .
because it makes sense as much as everything else that i &apos;ve heard about when it came to explain the absolute crazy machende of the creative process .
but then he got older and calm . he told me that one day he went to los angeles in los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
in this case , we have three siftables as farbtöpfe , and i can use them to pour color in the middle of the center where they &apos;re being mixed .
you tie d.n.a on goldpartikel and then you put the goldpartikel into that , and then i put it on zwiebeln , and then i put the lights on it .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re also going to expand , and then we &apos;re also very good connected , so that you can get people involved in it .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been able to do this since because of these archaischen models , very , very , very images , even though we &apos;re using a kodifizierte language .
but for me , in the realm of interactive media as a particularly impressive media , that we have , in our biological memory , that we have in our biological memory , the ability to think .
so you have to deal with what is , because it &apos;s not just easy to change it , but it &apos;s going to be better .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this , is , yes , gray is actually not , but here &apos;s just in this rosanen mass .
usability always means how can i get a certain goal , or how a user can do , or how a user is effectively effective , effectively , efficiently , to achieve a goal .
and because they &apos;re working a lot harder than we do and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption , something 30 billion people .
there &apos;s also abstufungen , whether you &apos;re learning it for the hausgebrauch , only passively understands , or you can also speak to the musical occupation .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of music to get it over a more possibility , so to make an instrument .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as if the first sentence was wrong , when you have to take the opposite , of course .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we can sort of the electric condition of the island in the order of one another .
now , in arguments , always , in arguments , this is always going to be tried , these insulaner , who are doing a very small web , which has nothing to do with our verbund .
okay ? there we were and fought by the wetlands and i keuche and schwitze , and i got matsch to my knees , and miguel in a silence .
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fischhaut . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows , which showed us animals and places and a world of miracles that we &apos;ve never imagined before .
i &apos;d nervte my father , until finally he finally found a tauchschule in buffalo , new york , on the other side of the border where we lived .
and it worked . again , we created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we have a little bit more money on the film .
so i started a company together with my good friend stan winston , who was at the time at the time of the best make-up- and creature-designer . she called &quot; digital domain . &quot;
you go up into those capsule , you go down into those dark , feindselige environments , where you don &apos;t have hope to rescue , if you don &apos;t make it yourself .
and i wonder what they would choose because i &apos;ve been asking my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
this is the greatest time that we &apos;ve ever had on this planet , no matter what scale you can do : health , wealth , mobility , secondary , declining .
we have the confidence in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be that way .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no relationship .
it &apos;s the erlebende self , the doctor anpricht -- you know , when the physician says , &quot; does it hurt if i &apos;m going to leave you here ? &quot;
you know jerry bruckheimer-filme , where there is the &quot; dream-team . &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientists , the ex-sträfling and the only one you can save the world .
when i &apos;m going to the next decade , i &apos;m sure two things : that we can create a future future , and we can play all kinds of games .
i would be so umschreiben : not the most powerful of his species , and not the intelligenteste of his species , but the ones that can adapt to the best .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical thing . but not the normal . and would you like to know this poor , gray person really wants to know if you were really there ?
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the life of life , but actually the biggest part , the basic mechanisms are pretty much the same .
i think we would all have the mood , the woody of all of the people who would understand , as he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get immortality through my work .
and by the way , we wander and zirkulieren and mixing us so much that they can &apos;t tell you that isolation is necessary for evolution to change .
so think of if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to be able to make genetic adaptations , the disease will cure and prevent it .
it &apos;s not going to take long , until the reality is going to be a thousand dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
these are also batteriepackungen , the motorantrieb is on their hips , as well as their kniegelenken , which they move forward in this pretty geschmeidigen and very natural gait .
it &apos;s a place where women are going to lead to sex with sex , &quot; hello , &quot; and the game is determined -- where fun is serious .
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have häufigen sex , also bisexuellen sex , with wechselnden partners , and laws such as conflicts and social angelenheiten .
and they &apos;re doing some tests and finding out that instead of eierstöcken , and uterus , in fact , they &apos;re actually carrying testicles and , and they have a y chromosome .
and a part of me wonder , what if the content of a character would be something that would be in the future -- could be made by fmri ?
i &apos;m going to meet all kinds of cool people ; my dollars is usually for a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s shopping to my personal personal schatzsuche .
and he drew back to the first time , in the beisein of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what was a feeling that was on the parking lot .
and just as the woman who wants to know me as adults , she turned to me , she turned into a box of asche , and turned into my hands .
over the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down-firmen and the &quot; no &quot; because they wanted to be part of the project .
and so i see myself as one of the people , together with most experimental experimental quantenphysikern , which need a good percentage to put the complex ideas together .
in that we gave him a little push , we could actually vibrate it at the same time , and not vibrate -- something which is only allowed in quantum mechanics .
the director of congress came to the stage , and i said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you for your lecture , but maybe we might be watching the tedtalk .
and these scientists have just documented the different topics that these ceos are dealing with , and how much time they spent decisions to make decisions with those issues .
well , if you calculate it , people bought six times more of a glass , who they had six to choose when they had 24 to vote .
tastemaker , creative teilnehmergemeinden , totally unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture , which everyone has access to , and in the audience in the audience .
can i give you a bug in your life , which is bold every wave of wave , the unbeirrte , steady tuckern of the engine , the complete horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee ?

but a particular fellow , a man named erik michaels-ober , noticed something else , and that was that the residents were frei the sidewalks , right in front of these parts .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then spread from selbt , is a kind of shot on the front of the government .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open up all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if it &apos;s the cattle ? &quot;
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of government fundamentally umzudeuten in a way that can actually achieve the society .
but these apps are like small digital memories , that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers who pay taxes and pay taxes .
now , if i want to record a different technology , let &apos;s say , this is a transporttechnologie , and then it would be very unvernünftig , it would be very unvernünftig , in the form of a flat line .
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my visitenkarte , i have enough for everyone in this room and even everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
we think because you &apos;ve taught us that the true question is : does a human being deserves to die for a crime ?
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up to my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear them . &quot;
and most of all , i want to do that , which is just just saying : lose the goal , don &apos;t give it to the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
yes , it &apos;s 97,5 percent of saline water , two percent , and we &apos;re fighting um percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether it &apos;s saltwater , polluted water -- and all that for less than two cents a liter .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake was only happened in the first five years , which many of my colleagues say , but total nonsense .
eight years ago i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .

so to buy new jeans , for many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long , and they need to überlappen them with other pieces to build smaller sub-einheiten to build these fit .
in every step we made these pieces in the surplus that we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and konvertierte completely in a new species that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
we have now come from our discoveries from all around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the designkomponenten of the future .
we &apos;re able to improve a lot of people from it . our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that was ever addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that are less than a milliardstel second after the universe -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
everything you have to do is look at the bitter todeszahlen of really great minds from the 20th century that young and often died of your hand .
look at the area of eastern pacific , from the american continent west and beiderseits of indian subkontinents , where there &apos;s a dramatic decline of the oxygen in the ocean .
and that is , yes , that &apos;s mostly quite a young people , but the only thing that &apos;s actually all united together , is this fascination in the technology .
now it &apos;s not so easy , but it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not impossible when you have enough curiosity and enough energy , then you get there .
and the exciting thing about this is , if you look at this , this new society structure , these computergesellschaft , a lot of the mechanisms , a lot of mechanisms , principles and archaischer paradigm models from the stammesgesellschaft .
as you did in the village at the time , who has what , who , and when , this is what happens today to our own selves on global scale on global scale .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , and if i can have the experience , the play that i have so long in advance , how to experience .

and the windkraftanlage or the solaranlage or whatever it is , in the rule , is usually a system system or a system , which can only be in small quantities here .
so , from that , you also know that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from this abwehrhaltung to the idea , the idea , 100 percent renewable .
we started talking about music , started by bach , starting by beethoven , started bruckner and all the other bs , from bartók to esa-pekka to esa-pekka .
it &apos;s a river that is leading all of the things that are affected by these rivers today , to lead to them to lead chemical pollutants , flow of waste .
one drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because these love , like romantic , is also aufschlussreich .
now , when we move on and down to age , we say 40 years or so we &apos;re going to see that accidents are even the leading causes of people to worry about the people .
and my nose would always put in a book , a science-fiction-buch , which is my thoughts in other worlds , and in a deep way , my deep , unersättliche curiosity .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep ocean , even in the flacheren oceans , is as rich as we can really imagine .
after the success of titanic , i said to myself , &quot; okay , i want to put my hauptberuf as a filmmaker in hollywood in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to go for a while . &quot;
because of different successes in lichtsektor , by other successes , through new methods in the häuserbau , there are a lot of services that have a lot of services to decrease for 90 percent .
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than you do today -- that &apos;s not that dramatic .
but this is when i wake up at night -- one of the things that keep me awake at night . we &apos;ve never used scientific progress as well now .
and i can tell you that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never seen again .
we have to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time time and go into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
the second curve is a conscious experience of experience and memory : it &apos;s actually between happy to be happy in his life and happy about his life or happy life .
and the third is the konzentrations-illusion , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a single situation that affects well-being without its significance .
there &apos;s a erlebendes self that lives in the present , and the present is able to experience the past , but basically the present .
when i tell you that someone has his life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot more uncertainty about how happy he is with his erlebenden self .
it &apos;s going to take a long time , and people will discuss whether they want to study whether or whether they want to study lebens-bewertung , so we need to have this discussion pretty soon .
it &apos;s called dr. pizzutillo . a italo-amerikaner , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t correct correctly . so it was called dr. p. .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of human beings , to survive , is defined by the struggle of the human spirit , to transform through conflicts .
and secondly , as a species we have our environment , our environment , that we have managed to adapt to ourselves precisely and we adapt to them .
and so far the isolation , when we &apos;re exploring as a species of planet planets , it will be isolierung and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses not just protection , but also to the immunity against other viruses .
we &apos;re going to have a process that needs perhaps 100,000 years , and we can compress it into a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .

and they went away from explanations , and meadows things like a supernatural concept of power , back , where the transmission of a very vagen concept is based on a very vagen basis .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in &quot; i have a dream . &quot;

so one day i decided to go to the leader , and i asked the ladder , &quot; works that model that you &apos;re really providing all of these possibilities ? &quot;
so the people who decided to participate in the more part tend to give them the more possibilities , the more they were wasting it and funded them .
unlike the einseitigen entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or doing something new .
so the things that make a picture of realistic look , i think , are the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everyone -- maybe most of the electronic gesundheits-projekte failed : because we stopped listening .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people all over the country who are up and writing and writing every day in their own communities .
well , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .

i said to myself , &quot; whoa , listen , you know , you and i both know when this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
there are also some nice opportunities in education as languages , math or logikspiele , where we give people the possibility of fast trial and the results immediately want to see .
you &apos;ve got to imagine that if you do something of classical music , five hours , you need five hours and this new kind of natural software only one hour .
that means that if we can look at existing technology from one another , for example , the metaphor , then i can use this as a creator .
osit osit at the end of about 50 to siebzigtausend times of activity , so in the sleep , you have noticed that it &apos;s less often less often than a day .
and through this kind of transmission , like with the metaphor of the desktops , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a handlungsmusters , a handlungsprinzips .

it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a 3,5 truck , which has to go under a 3 bridge , which is what you can do , you know , sort of quetschen underneath .
the other note is whether we use the null-emissionen technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of them , the ones that work , if their work works , to work for their pilots to work for their pilots .
there &apos;s a forschungsrichtung that is called geoengineering , which is befasst with various techniques to delay the warming , so that we &apos;d gotten 20 or 30 years longer to get us away .
and from my point of view , the scientific method is to try to see if it works , if it doesn &apos;t do it , the greatest achievement of humanity .
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul runs up and talking about vaccines and says , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop jammern .

in one case , you might have someone with a xy chromosomenbasis , and the sry gene of the y chomosoms läßt the protogonaden that we &apos;ve all had to grow up to hoden .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more androgenen than a woman who was born with testicles , and a androgenrezeptor-defekt .
it was all over and over and over and over and over and over this week when people came to me , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
the dropper streift foundation is based on the gray box , if one particular configuration was discovered . even , if that special program , which is trying to infect it on this goal .

so there &apos;s big preisherausforderungen . there are challenges in the transmission . if we say that the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they have to deal with the risk of where it comes from .
we know now that gender is complicated that we need to admit that nature is not pulling the line between male and female , or between male and intersexuell and female and female and female and female .
so we started with some of the volunteers that we had , a little more than a year ago , in seattle , to tag things that they were -- different kinds of things that you can see -- things that you might throw away .

so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success at the health of their predators , but a farm that is literally a wasser-aufbereitungsanlage , and not just for those fish , but myself .
this was the surrealste form of a déjà-vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i took a corner , i used to know what was going on in the lichtkegel of the vehicle , because i had passed the film for months when i was making the film .

you &apos;re doing it around the task , the challenge , and the ocean is the herausforderndste environment , which is there . you &apos;re doing it because of the strange connection , and because of the strange connection of people forming a team .

and one day he looked at me at one of my favorites -- these were just tiring and gnadenlos -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a big , brave and young girl , you &apos;re going to someday one day .
and dr. kean kept telling him , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if you don &apos;t have ever said something else , and even if you get a little bit of support , if you get a little bit of support , you can do a lot of time . &quot;
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows with this picture in the room , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is something very interesting in the past decades .
i was committing to the place , and to his brother and his father -- &quot; good , my proposal is like this : tony &apos;s going to talk to him , we will get a device and we &apos;ll find a way to get his art .

and in this song , we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be the possibility of what we are : people with full consciousness that are aware of the importance that all humans and gardens have a space to flourish , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans of one way , and they bought it , and they were schlecht , and they were unglaublich , and when they beat them long enough , they &apos;d have been gewaschen , and they had a lot of time , they started to say &quot; ok . &quot;
after all , a consequence of a schlecht jeans jeans when there &apos;s only one way to buy it , if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you &apos;re wondering why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is , what could you do ? what could you do ?
so she goes to the house , and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem through her and she takes a pencil right now than she hindurchgeht through her and then -- she said -- she was like , with her other hand , he would reach and get it .

this works really , this will be done in academic science , and we thought , well , you know , you know , you know , we might get a webcam , then we took a webcam , the lens , the lens , the lens , then you have a microscope that breaks down about vierhundertfach .
and in front of the background , i have a lot of interface interface interface , so the next generation of the human computers in which the human computers are so busy in the relationship of the human computer , how our tools , or how the computer is changing .
and there you see that you have seven senses , most of the time , we have only five , now , that &apos;s seven , you know , there &apos;s even seven , in the near future , which is probably the next , eighth sense , and as an extension of our self .
i &apos;m probably there , the two nice girls , i &apos;m probably part of the generation that &apos;s made for this bad öko image , because i &apos;ve already started studying intelligence in karlsruhe , technical school , engineering school , today , i think , i believe , i think kit .
well , what you could do with patient a design , and we actually did some clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , you could actually do the darmspiegelung of the patient a small way to stick on it without too much .
i read this list of a friend of mine , and i had to laugh , it seemed so ridiculous , but i only came up until &quot; zugerichtet &quot; and i had to stop reading , and i had to stop reading and to start collecting the emotional shock .
you know , as michelangelo shaped the moses , he says he took the hammer and he threw him on moses -- in fact , you can still see a little spot -- and said , &quot; perché non parli ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;

it looks like he looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really looks for is someone who is looking at him when he &apos;s eingeschneit , because he knows he &apos;s not very good in the brandbekämpfung when he &apos;s a meter of snow .

the first project we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we were aware of ourselves , we &apos;re really aware of ourselves , there are now as real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re going to know the people that are always looking at and so on .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to close to the evidence , and i want to be able to get the hint of the suggestion , to come up with a new way to get to new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much .
this is actually beautiful , if you do that , so agriculture does , it generates biogas , in a hectare of a hectare of five thousand people in favelas , in favelas , can make a farmer &apos;s farmer , and the anlage , and the enten and the enten , and the enten .
here you have this zensor between the unbewussten and the conscious , which instantly anspringt , without you can do something about it , and the things that you know that you &apos;re going to look very much better for you and others .
these may be a moderaten contribution , and if you do better than i expect , it would be great , but my kernaussage here is that we have to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give them a compelling problem because they have significant problems .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate proper , whether it would work , but since then there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that it &apos;s working . with the right materialienherangehensweise , it looks like it &apos;s working .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo-effekt . it seems strange that a magician is interested in it because , you know , it &apos;s like i think , &quot; a deception , &quot; when you think of it , &quot; a deception that &apos;s true . &quot;
so where the founding fathers were extremely disruptive to find out how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re going to be able to make a concept of it , not just like protecting them , but how we can worry about each other .
in fact , i &apos;ve looked at the biggest part of my career , and it seems to be the most important thing to try to look at social problems that they &apos;re going to be compelling and interesting , and hopefully , in a sense , what makes them useful and accessible to the audience .
and the realization of president lobo , was that the confidence that i was thinking about when i was a way to get the foreign investors and building the city for all the parties for all the parties in honduras , for a lot of years under fear and mistrust .
but i remember the lights in front of the coast coast of the coast , and the young man , who had collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apfels , which gave me one of the men on the platform .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design , taking a year sabbatical and work in a environment that is so pretty much everything that you actually hate to work with .
and the next couple of weeks , i felt , and i learned the first time myself to get rid of the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you can feel because you cannot talk to the colleagues about it .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we all would speak only one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be the language reporter . let &apos;s be kantonesisch .
there are a number of pilotprojekte that can do this on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be 100 percent to get it very difficult , and a resolution for the lagerung of the co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the lagerzeitfrage .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem in front of your eyes , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you have to get the things faster , or that innovation needs more than we expect .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you can make that the erlebende self is a bad thing , and you have it , that the erinnernde itself is a much better way , because now you &apos;ve given a better story about his experience .
and i had to repeat , literally , of course , of course , with these big übungen , elastischen bändern -- in different colors -- you know , to build my bein-muskeln . and i hated this tape , and i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
so what does that mean when we look back at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space , people in evolution , and especially how we vorausschauen into the next phase , i would say it &apos;s a series of possibilities .
so the tedtalk put in a very simple form that a city city is a place whose very beginning is unbewohntes land , a gründungsvertrag , which defines the laws that are there and the ability to decide to be either under those rules or not .
now in the world of sparens , i think one of the best examples that have recently come to the market , how to be best the choice of choice , was something that david laibson has had very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the convenience of the life of an unknown vororts -- a grandmother , a mother , and two daughters , and two daughters , who were telling each other &apos;s stories about their day , and they were still saying three times in the same bed .
at that point , the patients come to the game . they can &apos;t just take control control , stay on your own ship , but also help us in health care in the face of the challenges that are in front of us , and so on .
&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; something that my friends at autodesk call &quot; infinite-computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that allow it to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , nano-materialien , impfungen and artificial intelligence .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical göttliches , which was believed that it was literally living in the walls of a künstlerateliers -- about like dobby , the hauself -- the rauskäme and the artist &apos;s work in the work of work .
and then the renaissance came and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- about all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for mythical creatures .
and problem that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a zugangsproblem , which is how things simplify , so one of the things that can make a question , and how you can do it better , and how can you do better ?
and then came from the do-it-yourself-bio website of the founder , and he said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got to really meet ourselves now , even real estate , and then has organized two events , one in london , zweitausend , zweitausend 10 , zweitausend , in the u.s.a , in san francisco .
that &apos;s when you focus a laser on one in the room , then you can capture little particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then , in this focus , and then , that &apos;s just sitting there , like such a kind of a traktorbeamstrahl in the way .
i was afraid , not meinetwegen , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship with the violin , if i started to speak about a scale and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didaktischen .
i wrote this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; avatar , &quot; which was the messlatte of visual effects and computergenerierter effects in all the new altitudes , with comparable human , expressive characters that had been created by cg , and the world should be cg . and the world should be cg .
in some of the following expeditions i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermalquellen , and sometimes things i had never seen before , sometimes things that had never seen before , and for the science at that time , when we saw them , didn &apos;t even find words .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we &apos;ve done in antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think quite often in relation to how often i think about other urlaube .
so what you got was this : her name here is , my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and the point they would be able to make the ears , especially by the ears , especially when i could get their company stupid .
so by contrast color , contrast and contrast to the edges of the individual images , photographic mängel , just like feldtiefe , entsättigte colors and disorders , wir color , we can see the boundaries between the various images and a picture of a single photograph , although a picture is basically hundreds of planes .
and when these people came and looked , who was the best protein-ordner in the world , it wasn &apos;t a mit-professor , it was not a caltech-student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was the best protein-ordnerin in the world at night and was the best protein-ordnerin in the world .
the computervision-algorithmen put these pictures together , so they put the real room , where these images were made up near the grassi lakes in the canadian mountains , and they &apos;re looking at elements of stabilisierten slides , and they &apos;re all gesetzt in relation to each other .
but if we look at this metabolic map that is very simple , compared to our own . trust me , that &apos;s easy , but if we all look at these genes that we can eliminate one after the other , it would lead to a living cell .
but we zucken not even , if we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of statements for such a long time . somehow we have verinnerlicht the notion of creativity and collective , that creativity and suffering and suffering -- always leads to the seelenqual .
in other people &apos;s painting , she was not fast enough . she ran and ran , and she didn &apos;t get the house , and she didn &apos;t get the poem , and she was pouring it through her , and she said she would go to the country , and she said , &quot; „ , „ after a different poet . &quot;
well , not exactly what i hoped i had , but i went up -- the stairs , the stairs , along the hallway , the real , &quot; the real &quot; feuerwehrmännern , &quot; which was at that moment with the löschen , to get a pair of shoes .
another example : a few years ago , i got the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , who was a young boy , he had a friend , he had sex with his girlfriend , and he had just figured out he had a father and a uterus .
so we have such a situation where , the further our science technology , we have to say to ourselves , that these categories that we had thought of for robust anatomical categories , which made very simple zuordnungen to create permanent identitätskategorien , is much more unschärfer than we did .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in iran in the case where a man feels compelled to other men , which is when he gets engaged , unless he &apos;s ready to participate in the way that he is alive .
we have this lebensplan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought of all the people i wanted to give a hand and didn &apos;t do it , all the fences that i wanted to do , and never did .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to get too much , and you &apos;re going to get rid of the unwichtigen possibilities , you &apos;re going to have the cost of sales , you &apos;re going to reduce the cost of verkaufszahlen &amp; amp ; and there is an improvement .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta go down to friday . everybody &apos;s looking to the weekend , weekend , weekend . friday , friday , friday . you didn &apos;t think we were going to have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
how often do we have chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we get back and we expect the government , our values , and we don &apos;t have a lot of changes ?
the reason for that is , if i draw it on a normal curve , where , let &apos;s say , these years are the years , the time of a species , and this is a random amount of technology that i want to share with a graph , which is silly .
and you see how far away we are , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , we &apos;re at all the time on earth , you can see that , for example , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s going to be a program for 20 40 , you know ?
and our goal was , we wanted to come to seventy to three percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest of the rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t recognize that there are only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way that it processes information doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three , three , but you see them as a group .
well , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little appetit i have on the zehren of memories , but even if you have more of it , you know , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories to the amount of money that we give the experience ?
in our desire to protect people who are on our heart and to tell them the cool , hard truth about their medical forecast , or even a forecast of the quality of life that they expect , we have to look at that we &apos;re not going to be disabled .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideenreichtum , with which you bring new elements into the game -- like the testes , and also , as it does , is making tremendous fun .
and what we &apos;ve done is actually a new way of using new kinds of network that has been deployed around the world -- and it &apos;s a mobiltelefonnetz -- and blind and aggregierte information from this network to use that to understand how the city works .
but there &apos;s only one company that was prepared to help us -- and that also , because i know john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years -- i found that i had to do it , i had to deal with the mittelsmann and my team .
so we &apos;ve done in a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , we &apos;ve done a study with people at ing -- employees who have all worked for ing -- and these people were all in a gathering where they signed their participation .
these older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr , stevenson , you &apos;re talking about talking . they tell people to stop saying that we should stop doing it for the first time in our nation &apos;s history : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
in my about 20 years of medical research and journalism , i created a personal medical study on medical mistakes and wrong treatments to make all sorts of things for me to my first article , &quot; white , &quot; i wrote to learn .
i think a signifikanter -- not the only one , but a signifikanter beiträger to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned that they have the enttäuschend because they have to explain these experiences , and then , when they have to explain these experiences , they think it would be their fault .
a group of ankara that i met before a while ago , which is a studentengruppe that wanted to give the public to the public , which is what they learn in university , and they &apos;ve tried to explain , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what &apos;s wrong .
many of you will know the story , because from steves articles that became a book , a book that became a book that was verfilmt , robert &apos;s junior as steve lopez and jamie foxx ayers , who ended up on the juilliard-konservatorium and the very promising career with his paranoide schizophrenia .
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists we &apos;ve done , we only need a few million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable to work , you know , it &apos;s safe to work , you know , it &apos;s safe .
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a frage-und-antwort-sitzung after one of my lectures , who reported a story . &#91; unclear &#93; , he said he &apos;d heard a symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was absolutely wonderful music in the end of the recording .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of the verzweigungen in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , all the existing spezien on the tops of these branches have been achieved by success : you have survived ; it has been überlebt ; it has its environment .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could still tell you a lot more about what , and the many other wonderful things that you can do with sense , but i want to talk to you about the second part that we were at the beginning and that is the betätigung of our environment .
many companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re going to be afraid of , these elements , and that they &apos;re welcome to them , and they actually turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a geschickter schachzug .
but what &apos;s going to be found was 17 markenpartner who were willing to give up to the control of someone who wanted to do business with somebody who wanted to do so , and make them feel like i could tell stories that we don &apos;t normally tell -- stories that would never help to support .
and this is a rekonstruktion of the cathedral notre dame lady , who was just hitting the computer with the images of flickr , and they &apos;re just going to notre in flickr and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in a t-shirt , and so on , each one of these orange clouds represents a picture that was discovered as to this model .
you know ? i think to allow a mere person to think that he thinks he or she &apos;s like the gourd , the becken and the essence and the source and the source of all honesty , a little bit of a menschlichen , human psyche .
the people at the back or the , at some point on video , they &apos;ll say , &quot; well , yeah , it looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , it would be a hole , and if it really would be really , you know , it &apos;s a hole , and if it really would be real , it would bleed . &quot;
this may first seem a little bit more abwegig , so i repeat it , so i can do it , if we &apos;re about problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , and obesity , i think we need to play games online for the end of the next decade .
it would be great if we take this paradigm of the normal to another of the possibilities or the strength to put it in even a little bit more dangerous , if you could put it in a little bit of a dangerous way , so you can release the forces of very many and valuable skills in society .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build an entire chromosome chromosome . it has more than 580.000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we could actually build it in the kassetten of the virus to understand what the individual components of a living cell are .
and if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen , then you &apos;ll see why neunundneunzig percent of our software is very intuitive or not based on anhieb , which is i-pad in many areas , or i-phone , even though it &apos;s essential to an organic software .
and so i ended up with the people who were interested in space and to do with nasa , and they &apos;re sitting in the nasa-sachverständigenrat , and they &apos;re going to go to russia , and they go through the mission of the mission , and then they fly to the international weltraumstation , and we take our 3d-kamerasysteme .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the draper prize for francis arnold and willem stemmer , two scientists who developed independently the natural process of evolution that encourage the natural process of evolution , which is called direct evolution .
if i show you 600 papers , and you put them in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and those in 20 categories , you believe that i gave you more choices and i gave them a better choice than i gave you 600 .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all in your feelings about politics and the snake in the arbeitsamt and all the other things that we really upset about , is the government , in the core , in the words of tim o reilly , which we can &apos;t do . &quot;
if you ever have the chance to work in your städtisches , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- in fact , they do all of them -- you &apos;re going to see that the people who call government , including a lot of different problems , including the government , including many different problems .
and from a conversation today with dean kaman , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me permission -- he gave me permission -- his technolgie , which is the &quot; slingshot , &quot; and many of you have heard . it &apos;s the size of a kühlschranks .
no biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species before extinction are because it simply isn &apos;t true , and yet , this -- that -- that -- that &apos;s not what we refer to as a optimistischstes szenarium on the ground of cultural diversity .
and that was really , very , very bitter and you get into it , and then you put a picture on your body , where i asked myself for 10 years , a thousand , a thousand years ago , a thousand , einheitslohn , of course , of course , whether that &apos;s really the great thing to be with .
i mean most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve figured that out -- you know , the psychological presence is about three seconds long . what does it mean , you know , there are about 600 million of them in a month , and most of them don &apos;t leave us . most of them don &apos;t leave .

now , let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first shoots of living , perhaps three to four billion years ago -- and then the human species , which is the last few years in the last few years .

so that the system that &apos;s going to be able to create , which is to make it easier to find mistakes that are inevitable , and it makes it possible to create , supporting spaces where everyone who is watching health care , which is a potential to be able to do , and it should be rewarded for people like me , and that &apos;s actually rewarded for people like me , and that &apos;s actually rewarded for people like me .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglas , the schallschwächung , and all the way around , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human being , if you &apos;re working on the ocean , you can &apos;t tell the other thing , and you can &apos;t tell anyone to do it . that &apos;s how you can &apos;t explain to somebody .
really , really extraordinary , i found that he was collected by my whole childhood , whether i &apos;d won a buchstabier-wettbewerb in the second class in the second grade , whether i was on the unterwegs to the unterwegs , whether i had my scholarship , and he was using these clips to teach his students to teach his students to teach their students , medizin-studenten medical school .
normally my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies , which are the ones that are at the beginning , and i thought , because i &apos;m here under friends , i would tell you what i really think we can do , and we &apos;re going to go back to what &apos;s really going on with these incredible ideas .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the way we interact with real objects -- with my fachberater patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi , i started wonder : what if we could use computers , which would be like a digital fingerspitze , which is how we might be able to do it with two hands , which is , if we could do it with two hands , which is how we could do it with two hands .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the penan in the woods of borneo , or the voodoo-akolythen in haiti , or the warriors in the kaisut-wüste of nordkenia , the curanderos in the anden , or a karawanserei in the back of the sahara , and this is the colleague that i traveled to the desert , or even a month of the middle of the sahara , or a yak-hirte of the world .
a riesenerfolgsgeschichte , but , of course we have the problem of a growing company , and we then have zweitausendsechs , a small group , decided we &apos;re going to go back and go back to the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s what i think is , again , it &apos;s going to be a little bit crazy that people say , what it &apos;s going to do , that it &apos;s going to be a little bit crazy , that it &apos;s going to be a little bit crazy again .
i &apos;m going to give my abschließenden words to a english scientist , humphrey davy , who , as i suspect , when he argued the nutzlosen of his lehrlings , his homework was michael faraday , he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the development of the human mind , that there is no mystery in nature . &quot;

and we companies have a series of trips to the ethnosphäre , where we take our audience to places like these cultural wonders , that they were blinded by the subject and hopefully , and hopefully they &apos;re going to take one after the other revelation of anthropology , that the world is able to do it in a very multikulturellen pluralistischen world , that the wisdom of the world is able to do it in a really multikulturellen pluralistischen world .
so , i &apos;d like to zusammenfassen my talk to my talk , and in the sense that the qualities and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the vogt , and the skills that we &apos;ve been acquired from the vogt , and the rest of that is a little bit of a verschütt , and that we &apos;ve got to come back into the way that we &apos;re going to be in this way , but we &apos;re going to go back to our roots .

so what makes an amazing effect is not just the potential potential of this präparats , but it &apos;s going to be made out of two different sources . it &apos;s going to be made out of two different sources , and on one side , there is this wooden liane , which is a series of betakarbolinen , which is a little bit like a blue trüber , which is a little bit of a betakarbolinen rauch , which is a little bit of a betakarbolinen of the family .
one of them is required by the great array of different salatdressings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is salatdressing , it &apos;s perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a choice , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on to be a good decision , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on to make you regret , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be a good thing to do , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be the positive alternative .
at the end of this amazing initiation , you &apos;ll suddenly be out of one day , and for the first time in your life , in age 18 years , you see a sonnenaufgang . and in this kristallklaren moment of the first light of the first light , it &apos;s going to be really , you know , what i &apos;ve been talking to you about . and the priests is going to come back and say , &quot; look , look ? it &apos;s really , you know ? it &apos;s really how i &apos;ve told
how can i talk about the connectedness between women over three generations , and how the amazing strength of these connectedness are in life of a four year-old girl , when she was sitting over 30 years ago , her mother and her grandmother , five days , and she talks to them in the back of this little girl , and she &apos;s a little bit of a little girl living in the back of this little girl , and he &apos;s going to be a little bit of this little girl .
from the medical point of view , you can look at that , of course , that my legs , the laser-chirurgie for sehbehinderungen , kniegelenke from titan and artificial hüftgelenke for aging , which allow people to actually use all of their own lives , to be able to create their own identity , not to be able to be able to create their own identity , not to be able to be able to create their own social institutions .

the ölknappheit is invented , but we have enough online-inhalte , so it becomes realistic for them , and they actually live in their real life without oil , so if they &apos;re anmelden to play , they tell us how much oil is , they &apos;re going to tell us how much oil is going to cost , how much oil is going to be , how much oil is going to be . and they &apos;re going to be able to tell you how much oil is going to be .
and wherever you go in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not the doom of the geweiht . these are dynamic living peoples , whose existence is verdrängt by erkennbare forces that are verdrängt by the capacity of the anpassung , which is the japanischen of the schlamm , which is the fluss of the schlamm , which is the japanischen of the schlamm , which is the japanischen of the schlamm , which is the japanischen of the schlamm , which is the japanischen of the schlamm , which is a volk of the
