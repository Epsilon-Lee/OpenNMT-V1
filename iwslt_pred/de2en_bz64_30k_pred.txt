it &apos;s interesting .
very expensive real estate .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m a writer .

that &apos;s hard .
not entmutigt .
this is felix .
the sun goes on .
the orange juggler .
yes , hello .
fantastic , right ?
that &apos;s wrong .
long , yes .
yeah , milliseconds .
the only way .
nullemissionen , yes ?
don &apos;t find it .
that &apos;s efficient .
all the umweltdiskussion .
not toxic inside .
but it goes .
yes , sort of .
music as a language .
lento , slowly .
i wonder .
that &apos;s the singing .
you need time .
a schüler student .
that &apos;s quick .
here it is .
this is vorbildlich .
not very sustainable .
they schlemmen . &quot;
that was fascinating .
an enormous challenge .
we need energiewunder .
thank you . thank you .
bg : thank you .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s awful .
paola . kermit .
he works like this .
very different term .
we know that .
dk : 60,000 .
and he says ...
a few less .
that &apos;s us .
it has sensors .
i swear it .
does that sound good ?
after a week .
you can go in .
i grabbed awe .
thank you .
that was incredible .
no hospital .
thank you .
... not yet .
this is scary .
it &apos;s generisch .
yeah . okay .
a whole lot .
jk : both .
i can help .
i was amazed .
ban is blank .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m tom .
thank you very much .
i created one .
are they all ?
we lose them .
oh my god !
ohhhhh , wowwww !
there was refrigerators .
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
we were poor .
after home where ?
centers were built .
my gut again .
that &apos;s not ...
bewerte them again .
we wake up .
i vertrete kids .
or before bombs .
it would be 1.76 .
it would be gewissenlos .
we love innovation .
we love conversation .
oh my god .
schlafmangel is ubiquitous .
there are online-kriminelle .
they sell zertifikate .
they durchbohrten each other .
thank you very much .
these days are over .
what do you want to do ?
they actually hurt .
everybody needs a goldfischglas .
this was the result .
i think they &apos;re abscheulich .
can we change it ?
just do your job .
this is betrifft .
this was about christmas .
this is the last one .
good work ! yes !
so let &apos;s see .
yeah , good afternoon .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
yes , that &apos;s going on .
what are media today ?
they have similar principles .
why does that happen ?
does anybody see anything specific ?
a dalmatiner , right .
i see the dalmatiner .
that &apos;s our present .
what takes fünfundzwanzig milliseconds ?
give pee a chance .
this is completely trivial .
let me tell you .
no tree is kohlenstoffneutral .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we can do it differently .
and it has to go back .
wonderful , huh ?
but the wrong things .
what do you say ?
every waste is nährstoff .
so not like detox .
we can do that .
does it feel curious ?
the work of interpreten .
it turns out comparison .
this is all interested me .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
you see it immediately .
i can claim everything .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
yeah , good afternoon .
the names today are projektträger .
we were 20 people .
that &apos;s already going on .
that &apos;s the system .
what a fish .
i wanted to support them .
let &apos;s call it .
that &apos;s me even .
what did they do ?
they fluteten the canals .
the farm is incredible .
there &apos;s no food .
can i be honest ?
and i was an artist .
it was really immensely profound .
who will make it safe ?
next , nuklearenergie .
that &apos;s great .
this is a wish .
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
who &apos;s the most successful ?
what was the result ?
there are also weltrekorde .
and i understand that .
people were playing nuts .
we are talking about it .
the data came in .
but you know what ?
not very often happens .
he &apos;s called paul offit .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
dark urine . dark urine .
there was no cantaloupe-melonen .
why do we do that ?
it &apos;s not a country .
because you know what ?
yeah , i know .
how do we know that ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
thank you , danny kahneman .
so you can do that .
it may sound bad .
players don &apos;t sit around .
glückselige productivity . fantastic !
this is exciting .
from conflict , creativity emerges .
there &apos;s no normal .
oh , so the one .
that &apos;s very good .
a couple more .
what about longevity ?
maybe 10 times .
he opens the door .
why not live anymore ?
these are going to be unwiderstehlich .
so it &apos;s true .
they &apos;re all important .
be a mentor .
who are these related ?
play is not silly .
so where do we go ?
ooh , thank you .
thank you very much .
first extension , second .
italy . yeah .
here &apos;s the video .
his name is tempt .
i stood him up .
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
they did it secretly .
that sounds scary .
you could see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
almost identical structure .
the power plant can explode .
i have a question .
that would have been okay .
that &apos;s very risky .
this is the kurzfassung .
überlegene technology .
it keeps you fresh .
hmmm , my brand ?
my name is amit .
i see this pluszeichen .
polite all of you have .
first , close .
but you know what ?
how do they care ?
let me summarize .
so how does this work ?
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy kimmel .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i lived in parallelwelten .
i don &apos;t know .
is it even photography ?
what creates the illusion ?
oh . a moment .
okay . thank you .
so they meet al .
and that &apos;s important .
they use their hands .
there are two ways .
i &apos;m going in here .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
the silence is ohrenbetäubend .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we &apos;re constantly breeding .
i thought about it .
i don &apos;t think so .
that was big .
here &apos;s an example .
let &apos;s talk about wasser-kriege .
what do these people need ?
hey , why not ?
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
1,000 , good .
i learned everything .
but i continued to work .
asked the nurse sachlich .
so she was back .
they gave their blutdruckerhöher .
their family were located .
and she did .
and i continued to work .
he actually gathered fish .
it was a zackenbarsch .
what &apos;s happening here ?
this is what happens today .
we have three hauptgruppen .
these people deserve money .
this is alfred gonzalez .
diginotar is a zertifizierungsstelle .
and privacy has to be given .
the stones are farbcodiert .
i &apos;ll stop that .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
the gebären of the spirits .
now , what does that mean ?
so , what does that mean ?
progeria nations are sending our fernsehkanal .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
the official dogma of what ?
these are all einnehmende questions .
here &apos;s another example .
third , eskalation the expectations .
do you want to join jeans ?
but i felt worse .
at first we only have signed .
why should we do that ?
seriously -- the demise geweiht !
and i always had it .
why not think about that ?
this is a jährlicher tauwasserfluss .
these rivers take the same rivers .
the wassermengen have expanded .
let &apos;s leave that .
they really loved it .
this is an interactive trickfilmanwendung .
... his own story invent .
so , why now hacken ?
this is what you see down there .
how do we actually work people ?
that sounds really unusual .
they had no books .
let &apos;s do a little zwischenbilanz .
from the vogt-zeitalter to the maschinenzeitalter .
we &apos;re not producing ourselves anymore .
it won &apos;t do it .
pattern recognition should work .
now you see the dalmatiner .
also a very interesting phenomenon .
you need to understand that .
this is called osit-modell .
and it depends on phosphorus .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
the phosphor-problem is much more critical .
it makes leukemia in children .
but that &apos;s not a protection .
luckily not , yes ?
so we are too many .
but where are we useful ?
we can back our nutrients .
in china , it was different .
the byproduct is clean water .
but we need this overall .
or take a lippenstift .
there is any footprint there .
we are in germany .
so it &apos;s two cycles .
all of that is kompostierbar .
this must be the altersunterschied .
he was over the age of the age .
his personal impressionen of seerosen .
that &apos;s what most of you know .
this is like sprechenlernen .
because you can train them .
were you ever insulin-resistant ?
it &apos;s against justice .
it will always give you more similar .
it &apos;s interested in feuermachen .
and he signed up .
because i can say everything .
these things are logical .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
this is a naturding .
so , the naturdinge presented .
it &apos;s busy with insanity .
there are four and a half thousand people .
it &apos;s just not technological .
what would all be done ?
and here &apos;s the picture again .
and then they set up .
i only loved two .
doesn &apos;t taste very well .
2.5 to one , great .
let &apos;s do it as well .
it &apos;s kind of verkuppelt us .
the chef had verkocht him .
he showed up the algae .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the futterverwertung ? &quot;
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
i &apos;ll never cook with it .
i don &apos;t like this question .
you want to feed the world ?
now i see greg lemond .
so they saw some magic .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what lessons have we learned ?
it &apos;s gone up so far .
first , we have the population .
today , 6,8 billion people live .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
and also , these vents .
and there &apos;s the lagerungsproblem .
that really solves the treibstoffproblem .
what should our testimony look like ?
this has the biggest impact .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i care about ?
we have to spread the message .
this is just a versicherungsmethode .
and even lomborg think .
it was a huge success .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and then to realize it .
i tried something interesting .
so what happened now ?
there &apos;s a schritt-für-schritt-anleitung there .
and why is that ?
diphterie , röteln , kinderlähmung ...
the result of this was devastating .
does anybody get measles here ?
so paul is a terrorist .
the data shows you all the time .
i agree with you .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i push my sleeve back .
but the key thing is , ...
yeah , here it is .
there &apos;s a lot of glücks-coaching .
but it didn &apos;t .
he had the experience .
there &apos;s an old study .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
they have so much uncertainty .
so correlation is low .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
and there are plenty of employees .
so the first aufrechte primate .
and finally , epic meaning .
they create a epic story .
edward castronova is a volkswissenschaftler .
this sounds crazy , right ?
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 1994 .
the game is from 2007 .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
i think rather than that .
how about fitness ?
is it all einbildung ?
or may it be possible ?
some are came and went .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
i wanted to hold ourselves healthy .
it cost 2,7 billion dollars .
these changes are in .
who does not want to healthier children ?
play doesn &apos;t just mean kinderspiele .
and this is called androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so what happened for years ?
and women argumentierten that successfully .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
will it have my height ?
will i like the color ?
good afternoon , all together .
here you see the city .
you see the timeline up there .
they saw the big importance .
and then everybody went down .
it really enjoyed him .
you can have this cloud .
here you can see roberto dancing .
here you see it .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
no insurance can be querstellen .
it turns off the engines .
i had a good life .
it feels great .
you can get the water .
but it was very sad .
and then something weird happened .
and that worked very well .
and it was better .
but it gets worse .
is that your opinion ?
i &apos;m a redundante person .
that was more to the emphasis .
put the camera out .
what else is more risky ?
we are a smaller brand .
that &apos;s a great question .
and this is a millionen-konzern .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . all right .
the numbers are very good .
what other brands do ?
that &apos;s a great question .
and it took 18 months .
i grew up in india .
so you just go to googleartproject.com. .
just further . a lot of fun .
these are all the metadata .
you see something fun here .
apparently it was quite popular .
they come from artists .
the answer to that is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
again , he showed him .
the two people called me .
it matches a thousand square miles .
one place is south korea .
here &apos;s the oil gang .
here &apos;s her gang gait .
the third technology : kategorisierung .
here are two different schmuckauslagen .
okay , a few more .
what am i looking at ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
and then it became international .
something versteifte in me .
loans and donors were sought .
so i decided to follow my gut .
just one journey there .
is it about the light ?
here &apos;s another example .
but it requires a lot of planning .
there &apos;s something else .
maybe even in our phones .
i work in solartechnologie-branche .
it &apos;s rapidly expanding .
so scott gets this anfruf .
they connected these two people .
did you see these guys ?
something very strange happened here .
this is what you see .
that &apos;s it .
it has billions of those .
maybe a few mutations .
but they do the job .
so it creates a rückkopplung .
that really made me sad .
but what do we do with that ?
and this opens up a map .
these are the apsaras .
my cousins walked around everywhere .
i will never forget it .
i will never forget that .
my brother was staring at me .
i was devastated by the ground .
i &apos;m going to admit something .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
we lost the contact .
the only country in the world .
i vertrete people in todeszellen .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
we love technology and creativity .
she &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
we want to eradicate masseninhaftierungen . &quot;
sometimes i urge too much .
so i went to the court .
once the judge saw me .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
crisis . death . disaster .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
and many people forget this .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
we think about energieknappheit today .
and there &apos;s good news .
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
and so it was .
i felt really good .
actually , i made two mistakes .
my second mistake was worse .
and the notfallpersonal all the strands .
and then it happened again .
he always showed up here .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
the other one had a strong diarrhea .
and it &apos;s the crux .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
my name is brian bateson .
it &apos;s about veränderbare normwerte .
it was my first sonnenbrand .
they &apos;re approaching five centimeters .
they were genetically erdrückt .
it &apos;s still fish .
this is a dead turtle .
once again , we started a living living .
she wasn &apos;t ertrunken yet .
it &apos;s not going to document .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
what do you do with zertifikaten ?
the firmenhauptquartier is right here .
they tap their internet connection .
privacy is not to debate .
so littlebits is open source .
they are the heimatländer of somebody .
our magazines are read by millions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
a has these benefits and risks .
now , it &apos;s all easy to have .
the answer is yes .
secondly , what economists call oppertunitätskosten .
they could have done better .
so let me remind you .
economists call this a pareto-verbesserungs application .
we have unique elements here .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
it contains huge jubel in the control room .
so we dry about 50 of the magnets .
okay , that &apos;s really what makes courage .
so , you know , you know .
so the question is : how ?
what &apos;s this thing for a thing ?
go and quäle cohen cohen .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
the dauereis is markiert with red .
this is a completely unhaltbares entwicklungsmuster .
this picture reminded me of something .
here he is turning the sun .
now i add a bass .
it was a pretty schickes project .
or they didn &apos;t have any fotolitografie .
no , no , far missing .
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is a game outside .
for example , this perception in context .
does anybody know what that is ?
so it &apos;s the n .
this is also a paradigm paradigm .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
we depend on two countries .
and that &apos;s what we take .
people over the urine .
there &apos;s no überbevölkerungsproblem on trees .
and we are too many .
so , imagine mozart efficient .
now this is the minimum line .
not all should be of course .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
technical mapping is the same .
if it &apos;s right now the waste is .
i started an institute .
so basically a translation of translation .
the beweggründe , writing it .
how and what does he feel ?
i have a nice example of this .
this is a getragenes part of it .
because for me she means memory .
now the instruments have come in .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
and how did that feel ?
i &apos;m going to shoot something through my head .
the mechanism comes from lying .
picasso says , just wait .
my wife told me it .
here &apos;s the little mechanism .
we can &apos;t just do that .
and then he can just davonlaufen .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i particularly hervorgehoben him .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
it automatically runs into the right idea .
again , you have it again .
and you have a problem .
thank you for your attention .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
no problem can be a problem .
it turns out smart-grid .
so smart-grid , a riesenthema everywhere .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible .
this is going to happen in the next april .
for nathaniel , music means seelische health .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
&quot; of course , i said .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i said , &quot; hühnchen-pellets ? &quot;
i &apos;m entliebte from this fish .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and the green was a disaster .
they have literally umgelegt the lever .
schlemmen ? i was completely confused .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
he shook his head , no .
this is a netzwerk network .
a billion people are becoming starving today .
creativity had to somehow come out .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
they live with chemosynthese .
this is what the dynamics really changed .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
in fact , the fortschrittsgesellschaft is based on energiefortschritten .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so this is a tough job .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
this is going to be an complication of this zeugnisses .
they shouldn &apos;t suffer other things .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
they don &apos;t spend time in machtkämpfe .
architects and engineers , luckily .
my grandparents were drängten these numbers at 70.
we have them bezwungen . pop .
so that &apos;s the good news .
same thing , just bigger .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
and that got me so confused .
take nothing out of it .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
nobody ever said that before .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
this is ideology , not science .
we lehnen nahrung food .
and why ? gentechnisch changed food .
it &apos;s like a kartoffel .
because we don &apos;t want to herumschieben genes ?
it also plays a role .
and the shape plays a role .
everybody &apos;s talking today about happiness .
so , what is a story about ?
they didn &apos;t change the story .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
but it &apos;s definitely not optimalsituation .
so this crazy story could be true .
so , we can do that too .
i read to you the post .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
widrigkeiten are simply our lives .
honestly , who &apos;s normal ?
i was really desperate to work .
the students are going to be embedded in grades .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
which would you like most ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
well , how could this happen ?
and this was 19 years ago .
well , i was the next one .
the hauptmann winkte me .
but the game is a formwandler game .
both of these are überlebensfähig , both lighting .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tiger .
monday : color is a powerful thing .
tuesday : adapt total .
thursday : confidence is the key .
they become a computer in free .
the morning , before the game .
the game starts -- silence .
the data was not available before .
the whole building was water .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
you can play with different kinds of things .
this is about five meters long .
and this video is in real time .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
this was the beginning of the journey .
we won a few awards .
this is a painting of a circle .
she did it for three years .
that &apos;s not the route .
so we start with a windows-dropper .
this is a piece of play , right ?
completely focused on a particular destination .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
this is just the arbeitstitel .
we need to think about what brands .
that would have no problem at all .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
a whole dish cool food .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
these things have a positivere effect .
how would you describe your brand ?
i really like beautiful clothes .
lawyer : i &apos;m a anwaltsmarke .
tell me about this world .
what else do you have through ?
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
or are they more likely to be a down-attribut ?
the film hasn &apos;t been recovered .
you go around and worship .
you want to join in the museum ?
now this is one of the images .
i &apos;m going to show you now .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
basically they do the same thing .
this is a picture of the object .
and we did that .
so we measured his movement .
we &apos;re in a field .
this is a picture of this place .
they actually get funding with one .
think of your own choices .
now we saw the opposite effect .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
here &apos;s a description of the road .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
this is a high unnützes kategorisierungsschema .
who do you actually want to inform ?
we have to slow the complexity slowly .
motors , gears -- four options .
well , let &apos;s do that .
he had uploaded a lot of naturvideos .
what &apos;s happened that day ?
that &apos;s it , very simple .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
who could have been able to do this ?
the story is not over .
i never met him personally .
no , no one had ever been a chance .
her mother was on her own .
the defeat would have been simple .
who ever would wish ?
i believed everybody could .
but it has an unexpected turn .
and yet , a realistic level .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
this is from a quarry .
how can we help you ? &quot;
and every morning i went .
and we created a ipad-app .
it gives you respect .
this is a humble little app .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
now , boston doesn &apos;t just have a call-center .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
good night , honey beutelratte . &quot;
so the occupythesec-bewegung has done it .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
we don &apos;t go further than that .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
and these are the neural structures .
they gave them an evolutionary advantage .
all these generations need very few milliseconds .
it &apos;s verworrene and strange programs .
so gewissermassen überflügelt gave us the technology .
we &apos;re in the middle of this übergangpunkt .
now we do this with airplanes .
i got a little bit scared of technology .
and the storytelling of storytelling is always needed .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
we use the energy of the sun .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
she was a daughter &apos;s daughter .
i should probably not do that .
this may be übertragen public .
my uncle died of alkoholinduzierten diseases .
many of my clients are very young .
this is a very sensitive question .
i talk a lot about these questions .
do you want dazukommen and listen ? &quot;
what do you try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
you should also tell them what they want .
then he screamed to me .
well , i walked the gerichtssaal .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
so the rate of growth itself is accelerating .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a wasserplaneten .
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-milliarden-marke .
we have the passion of a diy-innovatoren .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropen .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
it &apos;s the durchschnittsleistung of the schlägers .
it doesn &apos;t work , isn &apos;t it ?
but , you know what ?
i was a zwanghaft student student .
she was back and dying .
but slowly , it turns out .
i started feeling better .
alone , beschämt and without aid .
but there are two problems .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
all of that is inevitable .
and it starts with a doctor .
they share their experience with others .
i &apos;m the neu doctor .
people were still happy .
and nobody seems to be aufzuregen .
zertifizierungsbehörde hack and gefälschte ausstellen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
lego made it possible for all possible .
and it was an incredible experience .
and of course , we all share the same anpassungsnotwendigkeiten .
one language is expression of the human mind .
54 percent of the deaths happened by durchbohrungen .
this old man refused to be rejected .
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
but these are all the streets in the u.s.
now let &apos;s move something else .
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
this is my supermarket . no big .
and there are several reasons for this .
here &apos;s some on the hamptons .
everybody in my manhattener neighborhood is gone .
well , this cartoon does some statements .
the truth is more like this .
we started about 15 years ago .
it turns out it &apos;s very difficult .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
this is the hauptmechanismus of evolution here .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
we konditionierten them , reparierten them .
how algae -- and other furchteinflößende things .
if not , there &apos;s somebody else .
his whole arbeitsprozess has changed afterwards .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
it &apos;s about a neuversorgung of america .
i start with a few simple examples .
so for him , they were just bauklötze .
we wanted to develop a lernmittel for sprachlerner .
so , that was my primary motivation .
and the list you can continue to do .
more than these other two networks .
and that &apos;s really in the beginning .
now , what are really archaische models ?
so i want to show you that .
this is what &apos;s happened to be gennante .
on the book , and on the picture .
we have an abstract language .
the question is , what is going on ?
maybe a look at this again .
so the modern in the computergesellschaft .
every society is shaped by a primärmedium .
at the beginning , the stammesgesellschaft through language .
that the theme of ecology is a global issue .
in the third , i &apos;ve been forgotten .
you can see from the back to the front .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
it has to process it as the present .
how can i do something like this ?
and less usable or benutzungsfreundlich is it .
and what does that mean for the designer ?
i &apos;m trying to do this by a beispiels .
now , everyone has already ate pies .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
schütz the environment , make less waste .
the environment , verbrauche less energy .
this is just a little bit less destruction .
and everything is packaging , or content .
one baby needs about six consecutive diapers .
so with that , men can &apos;t be pigs .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
that means we need to zurückkriegen phosphorus .
but very effectively , yes , yes ?
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
we &apos;re thinking north to the north .
so not saving , prevent , avoid .
you can show , i was there .
that &apos;s what has just been shown .
there &apos;s this direct rücknamesystem .
if you come to that , yes ?
all over the place , these migrants are around , almost .
we can reinvent everything else .
so every concert is another concert .
there he and he said , like this ?
he has lived only for years .
so , interpretation is not spoken in the anfängerunterricht .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
tell that what you feel .
it &apos;s not just a nice geräuschtapete .
and this sounds very different from the time .
so the first step to take a interpretation .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
because now you can apply a dreisatz .
dreisatz you still know from school .
in this dreisatz , three sentences come .
and here you can see it .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
these sentences are absolutely logical and accurate .
say , there are no vorhersager .
there was the kernforschungsanlage leopoldshafen .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
it &apos;s like this big box .
we also got very precise data .
how far do you get there ?
and then we said , okay , okay .
very simple , it &apos;s going to come .
so i just started playing .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and so he entflieht his quälenden .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
the assumption of maybe two percent .
they have the flow of water conversely .
he picks up a rare gleitaar .
now , he mentioned the mineralbedürfnisse of phytoplankton .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
a fischaufzucht , but also a vogelreservat .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
it &apos;s this beißende , verkohlte taste taste .
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
you can go through a specific year .
we talk about the wounded massacre .
so i &apos;ll stop , thank you .
i was totally wissenschaftsbegeistert , you know .
i could draw . i could paint .
i didn &apos;t get frustrated with that .
so , basically my two passions .
so , that really blew me up .
we went back to the wrack of the titanic .
so this was a highly strange experience .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
for energy , i noticed this .
so here are some natural fireflies .
it should contain the two elements .
there &apos;s a lot to come together .
we need to use more money .
anyway , we need a solution .
bg : a energiedurchbruch is the most important thing .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
but there &apos;s another reason .
because they have special skills of prozessbegleitung .
what happened to these design-studenten ?
we went through this exercise with the same students .
and that can make a difference .
and everyone in this room has to be in .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
not even the truth of the truth .
we have masern in this country now .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we go to the poor of the placebo-industrie .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s quite , morality , patentkram .
so , look what happens .
and the goal is very simple .
i hold the knife in my hand .
what ? i really freak out .
usually i would take the needle out .
everybody would like to make people happier .
he had spent 20 minutes of music .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
there seems to be an interpreter .
that &apos;s what we get , absolutely flat line .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
no , i mean it really seriously .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
we have 1.5 billion players in total .
five million people use it every month .
these fantastic spielecontrollern were there .
people suffered . people were fighting .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
here &apos;s the aktualisierte version of this eintrags .
we can give ourselves something like that .
maybe we can see widrigkeiten as a change .
but what will happen in the future ?
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
i remember my first fire .
and you know what i learned ?
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
intersexualität comes in many different forms .
so we have this awful vereinfachende idea .
they had a concept of blue blood .
we see the same thing in the behindertenrechtsbewegung .
how do you mention people because of their charaktereigenschaften ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
do we really want to go into this direction ?
in terms of this way , we don &apos;t exist .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
be just who you are .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
it &apos;s called &quot; conversation with me . &quot;
let &apos;s start with the sense .
it emerged four days ago in italy .
it was when the italy won the fußball-weltmeisterschaft .
and anyway , italy won at the end .
second halbzeit . end of the normal play .
zidane , in a moment of kopfstoß .
we called it the digital water .
the roof was covered with water .
you can do that all the time .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
but the truth is far away from that .
this is the average size of a grönland-eisbergs .
and that was the outbreak of it .
he can only use his eyes .
thank you so much , that was incredible .
this is something like our kampfschrei .
it comes from our own pockets .
and i had to go away from the city .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
he says , &quot; bereitmachen . &quot;
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
okay , you really want to know ?
i went to prison -- difficult .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
with which words would you describe ban ?
man 3 : i &apos;m the schmusetyp .
marke 5 alkoholsüchtiger schreiberling schreiberling .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i like things that are different .
the first one is a classic , apple .
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
are you achtsam and mondän like 007 ?
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
emc presents &quot; you welcome transparency &quot;
thank you , but the best thing is coming .
you can get very easily in and rauszoomen .
but then they really want to go deep .
another lieblingsbild of mine , sternennacht .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
just to präzisen voices , you can see .
the rest of the time they are delokalisiert .
well , that &apos;s not right .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
also , städtedesigner and -bauer are very interested .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
and i want to read to you the .
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
oh my god . oh my god .
actually , bear didn &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share one rainbow .
even cats look at this video .
nobody needs to give your ideas green light .
he went back to silence .
he died , broke by the story .
all adults were aware of the risks .
no apple ever tasted it again .
my mother suffered from alpträumen from the boat .
i was not familiar with the etikette .
there had to be another puzzlestück .
one year , we didn &apos;t have a dime .
we worked late until late .
her father died shortly after her birth .
&quot; they didn &apos;t dive . &quot;
secondly , combined photographs have the same beleuchtungsart .
it &apos;s from a different place .
we all have navigationssysteme in our cars .
and sure , we can find fastfood-ketten .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
oh , my time is over ?
so there &apos;s a nice little dynamic dynamic .
and that worked . applause for scott .
scott stated himself to human beings .
beutelratte ? yes . live ? yap .
so every tröpfchen was a little different .
the zellengemeinschaften started informationen information .
it could take place within a season .
speichere this one , lösche the rest .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
with 16 , i started to illustrate books .
it can know where we are .
i learned that from my grandmother .
there are some hochinteressante developments .
we &apos;ve already had a lot of effort .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
i think our identity is threatened .
we want something against death rates .
we want to cut down the number of deaths .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all .
he came to me and umarmte me .
i had written these crazy things .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
it was the fehlgeleitete kreuzzug against drugs .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
child mortality has a tenth of reduction .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
now look at this curve .
notice two things on this curve .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
the king of siam , though , got aluminium-besteck .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silikate .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
this is a problem for supercomputers .
you know how to call a 400ter ?
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
and giving feedback to my oberarzt .
maybe i did it with good reason .
they barely breathe and was blue angelaufen .
she schlossen her at the beatmungsmaschine .
she had not suffered a behandelbaren gehirnschaden .
this is the kind of lehrreicher shame .
but i asked these questions .
why went to medicine ?
at one point , i thought he had nierensteine .
it &apos;s totally denial of mistakes .
i thought i could integrate myself .
if you verallgemeinert it , this is happening .
the difference is then seen as a loss .
there can be a sequence of changes .
this is the goal now .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of inorganic animals .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
but western governments also help themselves .
but today we are far beyond that .
we &apos;ve also brought back to designschulen .
the ethnosphäre is the great legacy of humanity .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
it &apos;s our new homeland and is called nunavut .
every big picture is the beginning of a abschnitts .
or other models , or even technical specs .
oben up on the erdräumlichen picture of nasa .
there are those who are much more räumlicher .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
yeah . she does nothing else than discover .
the official glaubenssatz of all western societies .
i just want to say a little bit about salatdressing .
so this is how the supermarket is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
we keine no identity ; we invent it .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
i could park directly before my house . &quot;
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
it &apos;s what we &apos;re getting worse for .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
they laughed more than her .
so , this looks like a basketball-playoff .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it has a molekulargewicht of over 300 million .
it will provide a challenge for nine .
we take images of these mini-urknalle in detectors .
it just wasn &apos;t until , you know ?
oh , jesus , what a thought !
everybody knew her genius was a little paralyzed .
this is what was going on on the ground .
if your job is dancing , tanze .
and if it wasn &apos;t , you dance , your dance .
it grows in the winter and schrumpft in summer .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
you saw it in the news .
frosty , the kohlenmann will every day .
this is one , a part of her .
saueber coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean kohletechnologie .
versorge america . find more out .
we need to get far , which is fast .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and peril .
this is our youngest beta-tester at the bottom right .
now he &apos;s catching a tractor in the scene .
now i &apos;m going to do something more schlagzeug .
i can change the sequence as it happens .
i &apos;m delighted to be there .
yes , so what should be biohacking ?
as i said , it just started .
and that &apos;s what they do .
now , if you keep thinking a little bit further .
but i &apos;m going to talk to you again .
and then the verblassenden is einflüsse cultures .
what &apos;s left us is the storytelling .
i want to quickly explain a little bit about this .
and the two letzteren are also here today .
this is a forschungssemester of natural user interface interface .
to say alone , what is information ?
and further , you see it always .
this is what it says to be the norm .
and there &apos;s a central point there .
and of course , we can look at the müllproblem .
this will be balanced in china in a second .
because that &apos;s what it shows , right ?
have you ever seen a tree tree ?
we can support them , well to be good .
that means that the verbrechensraten goes back .
we can support them , well to be good .
and we see that it works .
but you can &apos;t replace phosphorus .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
then i say , herzliches beileid , yeah ?
but with the right design , please .
in two hours , they &apos;re moving everywhere .
do you remember the windel before ?
it &apos;s sort of a beneficial poop print .
and in my jugendlichkeit , i said , expectation .
the x-malige interpretation of a piece is this comparable .
especially when he died .
a phrase with his own breath to design .
so the instrument is the extension of our body .
because artists have a gestörtes relationship to lying .
because we cannot live without these lebenslüge .
a special story , like i am .
so it &apos;s going to come from the outside to people .
the logic doesn &apos;t make talks about reality .
we can continue these things to different examples .
gleichgroße forces with gegensätzlichem vorzeigenzeichen will solve each other .
and in berlin , there was a crazy ingenieurkollektiv .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
these were the first calculations about six years ago .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we have 30 gigawatts today in germany .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s first sentence .
it &apos;s hard to überbewerten the destruction .
he &apos;s got a futterverwertung from 15 to one .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your bäuche , pink .
every morning they fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
i mentioned this to miguel and he nickte .
and let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
with pivot , they can skip in a decade .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
as a child , i used comic comic books all the time .
i was basically obsessed with studying the deep sea .
these blöden films don &apos;t give us any money .
there &apos;s a connection , a respect .
so what can we do from all of this ?
it &apos;s also very important for them .
isn &apos;t half or a quarter ? &quot;
it &apos;s great that this number is rising .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
and what do you do with the waste ?
the last three of the five .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
there are lots of great books to this topic .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
you can predict that . why is this ?
they run the process , they understand it .
and i thought , you know , let &apos;s get the pokereinsatz .
there was never a time before that .
my ur-großeltern died all the time they were 60 .
my parents are the 80 on the fersen .
anybody even know what that is ?
this is skandalös and we should be ashamed .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
the guy in the middle wasn &apos;t so much .
and they &apos;re not only going to die on measles .
we had no kinderlähmung in this country yesterday .
do they all have their vitamins tomorrow ?
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo-industrie .
and i have all kinds of little requisiten here .
and you know what ? you have wrong .
they have them . they always have them .
and some of them worked , and some of them don &apos;t .
we &apos;ve got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
it &apos;s also a role role in a role .
well , i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
people in the nebenräumen are now coming in .
now , the erinnernde itself is a storyteller .
and let &apos;s start micht with an example .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
thank you . i have a question for you .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
this is a portrait of photographer phil toledano .
this is one of the classic terms in play .
this is a player that &apos;s a kurz victory .
i don &apos;t get the real life of this feedback .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
player are masters in spiders poet .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
what do you think happens next ?
antonyme : healthy , strong , sensitive . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
it was summer and i had shorts .
and of course , it &apos;s done a click .
come with me , dance with me . thank you .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130.000 years .
in front of him , it &apos;s a beautiful spärlich showgirl .
i &apos;ve tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to rebuild health after a disease .
it &apos;s the only test of survival and success .
we call these robots exoskelette .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
as i said , amanda carries our elegs .
he &apos;s a hoffnung hope from my consciousness .
the dog ! i was just envy .
now , chimpanzees are known for their aggressivität .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
play is the kitt that we face .
look at what she does .
in other words , play is our anpassungsjoker .
so two pairs , each zeugt a baby .
we come back to these people later .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to that .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
he had an extreme form of a angeborenen nebennierenrindenhyperblasie .
we don &apos;t know exactly why that happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
they moved to a konzept concept .
but how do you do that in practice ?
so i think we need to be leaders .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
and i &apos;ll just summarize that for you .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
well , we introduced the mayor to belloch .
here you see the building works .
i want to show you something here first .
it &apos;s a echtzeit-3d-scan and a bewegungsaufnahme .
so you can understand the whole movement .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important .
ordinary people are not accessible . &quot;
make it possible -- you all here .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a geräuschloses airplane .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bordpersonal .
i never want to move into life .
they probably knew the schuhgröße of the maschinenbedieners .
it looks like an old-fashioned assemblersprache .
so that made sense , it adapted .
so again , that &apos;s really fine .
it &apos;s natanz and it &apos;s just natanz .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressiver .
so this is where we need digital sicherheitssysteme .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
i worked in a kohlebergwerk -- dangerous .
no , that was what i thought .
it &apos;s unvorhersagbar -- like this strange landstraße .
i want to help you to calm down .
you should tell me something about my brand .
well , what &apos;s the brand gerry ?
i sell schmusetiere throughout the country .
tell me a little bit about this part .
we should put the bear in the cage .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so , the theme of the day : resource capital .
now , who is ready for this journey .
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
in 2010 , it had been 23 million times .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzlestückchen .
but that &apos;s how many people got over the years .
life has not changed for centuries .
&quot; it turns out to be a unwahr .
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
if i say reality , i &apos;m foto-realität .
and this is a very good deal with each piece .
it has a button on / .
i found my job at 95 pounds .
next week , this is the market .
we have herumgefragt , and nobody knew .
it might take it until it &apos;s rolling .
al is a hydrant in the city boston .
now , a lot of people have given up the government .
this is the call-center for service and information .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the beutelratten .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
and we use this word with such contempt .
... let &apos;s just show the slide .
all of those were began to fire .
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
the next step happened now within this community .
so , we have the zeitskalen again .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
now we &apos;re doing this with bohrern and machines .
they were inspired to be inspired .
it can know how we hold it .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
she had the last word in every familienstreit .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
i said , &quot; promised grandma . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
my grandfather was in prison in prison .
this land is different than 40 years ago .
wealth , not verschulden , affects the outcome .
anyway , we seem to be satisfied with it .
the death issue is an interesting question .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
it &apos;s an amazing fehlerquote . one of nine .
and yet there are these mental abkopplung .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;

eight : tsunamiwarnung . nine : nine : cyber-attacken .
different speakers : mass destruction . massenvernichtungswaffen . landfill .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
and we also saw this in mobile phones .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
and this is very important in the medizinforschung .
and this game was played by universitätsprofessoren and so on .
we have access to an exponential technology .
well , really good , maybe a all-star .
and that was not a difficult diagnostic .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s doctor .
and i went back to work .
the three words loud : do you remember ?
i was shocked , and until the inside .
and that was what i felt .
it was a lot of time and i was in a hurry .
it turned out to be a streptokokken-infektion .
he had a potentially lebensgefährliche disease called epiglottitis .
this is the system that we live in .
what you need is a new medical culture .
they &apos;re supportive when they &apos;re talking about their mistakes .
i &apos;m a person . i make mistakes .
yet , we still get to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the broschüren are still describing them as pristine .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
they &apos;re getting 64 because we &apos;re catching them .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
so you can &apos;t put them in wrong .
you just stop and you start talking .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and the problem is not the technology .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
and we can navigate that very simple way .
if they want to create them , they &apos;re hyperlinks between the images .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
to maximize freedom is choice .
and it &apos;s also profound in our lives .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
but niederlassen is not always a bad thing .
their problem is they have too little .
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfischglas . &quot;
our steps at analyzing life were exponentially .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built waterzeichen .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of automation .
this is not a elektronenmikroskopaufnahme mikroskopaufnahme .
this is footage about a long time from six seconds .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuel the fourth generation .
this is a organism we described in 1996 .
and they had to remove what we also did .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
at the end of march , the lhc will be functional again .
yeah , i &apos;m scared of all these things .
i may have another 40 arbeitsjahre in myself .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
this is one of the most schmerzhaftesten korrekturen of a creative life .
and „ olé ! trotz for you .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is 20 feet meereshöhe , like greenland .
trotzdessen is a political dispute in our country .
one of the commercials of the kohleindustrie around christmas was this .
frosty the kohlenmann is a vergnügter , happy fellow .
the most powerful bergarbeiter is the director of massey coal .
new investments to create good paying jobs .
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
i &apos;m delighted to talk to you all about that .
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself-bio dot dot , d.i.y.bio .
and then we did a code-of-conduct effort .
they virtualisieren the reality and the whole computer .
and in this head , memory was going .
the key tool has had been jeher since remains stories .
and they did this with something called lead-landkarten .
the language of the language is rang .
we have moved to the so-called vogt-zeitalter .
another example is called virtual reality .
anyway , they do this .
and we can now look at the time .
we understood that the weather is global .
so , how do we do that when we go ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to recognize something from this pattern .
and sechzehn milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is why we think about the wiege to the wiege .
in the ground , over the age of 60 percent is saved .
it &apos;s kind of like all of you in the vorwindelphase .
it &apos;s opec a bunch of waisenknaben .
because , you know , this is a lustvoller process .
it &apos;s a form of revierverhalten , yes ?
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
but everything that &apos;s inside is useful .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because you &apos;ve already changed the vorstandsvorsitzenden .
so , help me a little bit .
interpreten is the übersetzer of the geschriebenen music in klingende music .
in fact , the notes are very vague and ungenau .
you collect information about the piece in the sekundärliteratur .
so to keep zwiesprache right with the composers .
but maybe you can still do it .
can you actually play me in blue ?
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
it &apos;s just deciding you and not yourself .
so , we can &apos;t bear these things .
there &apos;s only the second second , the fire department .
this is the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
the first two sentences that are logical correctly .
i can say the kanzlerin is a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about what &apos;s going on .
so if klaus says , there &apos;s no soul .
but it wasn &apos;t that way in the achtiziger years .
now , they have an renewables today of 15 percent .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go further again .
and then it looks like this in the rule .
our goal was to just say , okay , okay .
this has no one in the world .
and then there &apos;s a whole bunch of simulation .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and that &apos;s the n of it .
and in time , they can respond to other things .
then we have to eliminate our must-run capacity in the net .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
let &apos;s call it miguel . actually , he &apos;s called miguel .
this is a fischaufzucht in the südwestlichen corner .
they made this by entwässerten the land .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
now i &apos;m going to choose the federal government .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
i grew up with a gehörigen portion science fiction .
we &apos;ll show it in the video of the movie .
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
in the process of discovery , i learned a lot .
i think first of all , it &apos;s curiosity .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
well , the energiepreis is over time .
this has to go down to zero .
this is the u.s. government for hundreds of years .
many talks from one 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
the hauptproblem here is similar to aids .
m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
now they understood the advantage of moma .
they produced the highest construction in the lowest time .
let &apos;s have a machine here .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they were just like the people in this room .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
this is a debatte debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
you know , there were no mandarinen in paradise .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
you know that science is not a company .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
there &apos;s somebody in the back there who had no childhood .
i &apos;m really sorry . does this crazy ?
let me show you the close .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
well , the erlebende self lives all the time .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
that &apos;s not how it works at all the time itself .
the erlebende itself has no voice in this election .
we think about our future as vorausgesehene memories .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
there are other pleasures , but that &apos;s dominant .
well , you &apos;re not going to get happier .
the more money you deserve , the more you are happier .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
we &apos;re developing our way of collaborative , thank you very much .
you would expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
what we want is to create the future .
so i say , let &apos;s start the weltverändernden games !
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open you doors ?
look , dr. kean changed his thinking .
again , what potential do we want to draw from now ?
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
raise your hands . let me see .
how many would choose for a good memory ?
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
so go ahead . save your shoes .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
we learn how to trust and the rules of the game .
but are we going to make the best of our spieltrieb ?
imagine that just for a moment .
we produce androgen and we &apos;re talking to androgene .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
i &apos;m a jessi and this is my suitcase .
france makes an airstrip . italy makes an tor .
this is something that is built in the city .
very rarely , you actually witness a rollenden iceberg .
on the left , you see a little boat .
tempt was one of the leading graffitikünstler of the &apos; 80s .
so they communicate -- so their fingers walk along .
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
so they &apos;re moving around and doing kunstinstallationen like this .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
now , there &apos;s all this rummel .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingbroke .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
it was something we knew to do .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
this is a clip from this angriffs- code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
these results were hard for several weeks .
the idea is to cheat a digital sicherheitssystem .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is generisch .
you could also use ordinary wurm- technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
so the driving force behind is the cyber- superpower .
i photographed in kriegsgebieten -- difficult and dangerous .
do you know how many people see these tedtalks ?
it was &quot; in time , forever . &quot;
what do you think the answer is ?
the answer is going to be very likely &quot; no . &quot;
didn &apos;t want to do something with the movie .
actually , no , that was not the mistake at all .
and then we offer one of these great düfte .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
these are the people who shape my worldview .
it &apos;s like i want to be .
there &apos;s a lot of crazy things going on there .
and that &apos;s what these tags have done .
he &apos;s not in other countries coming out .
you can look at all these museums here .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
i love this guy ; his expression is unbezahlbar .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , in a second .
but what if you want to see the pinselstriche ?
you go inside . you can really go into it .
this is sternennacht , probably never seen before .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but i didn &apos;t like my logical side .
in the summer of 2009 , benjamín honduras was suffering from a severe verfassungskrise .
he asked octavio to become his stabschef .
in fact alone , this airport has a place of 100 quadratkilometern .
the faces of the audience were very serious and paying attention .
a typical walmart today offers 100,000 products .
i think i may have heard more hands .
because the pictures made it real sense for you .
three things : tastemaker , teilnahmecommunities and unexpected .
it was almost 200 million times this year .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s going to be put together .
my grandmother never dreamed of me .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the besteck .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
is it about the details or the colors ?
so i think the basics are very simple .
and let me show you a simple example .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
i &apos;m always going to start with a sketch , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
we know one more , where all the gas stations are .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
he called &quot; beutelratte &quot; in the official database .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real regierungsarbeit is happening .
we need to get to the engines of government .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
these little öltröpfchen were in the sense of primitivste zellenform .
and trying to do that again with another generation .
and i will get a character in the book .
fireflies , in a jar , found it quite exciting .
and the light socket through the rest of the book .
it also turns out to other places in the book .
at one point , the screen is filling up with leaves .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
we &apos;re just alberten around there as well .
72 were 300,000 people in haftanstalten and prison .
i think , in my world , masseninhaftierungen has changed our world .
in many places people had to fear lynchmobs .
so these women were meeting , and they were just talking .
and i went over and i stopped .
wr people want to help people who have been innocent .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
and then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
and i have to say , there was power .
10 minutes later , the judge quit a break .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
so the dramatic numbers come in the prisoners .
recession . gridlock . egypt . syria . syria .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
so the amygdala is our selves , our gefahrendetektor .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleons soldiers got silber-besteck , napoleon himself .
it &apos;s new nanotechnologien on the way , nano-materialien .
this is technologieunterstützte innovation that exists today .
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to want ?
i studied ms. printers , and she was in atemnot .
i hired them and made me the treatment .
i remember that it was yesterday .
both cases of mine , fraßen me .
some of my klöpse happened in the last five years .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
you know , he was 1835 here .
he described one of them as very usual .
now he &apos;s up on the red list .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a huge loss .
the question is , why people accept this .
this is wladimir tsastsin from tartu in estonia .
somebody was hacked , and he had gründlich the system .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of diginotar .
it was called automatically verbindende stone .
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
and we want to make this stuff available for everybody .
we &apos;re all born . we bring kids to the world .
and the key key to this is extinction .
but they didn &apos;t just kill the außenstehende with the soldier .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
it &apos;s an independent area . it &apos;s all controlling mineralvorkommen .
this is a whole book , an example of nichtbild-daten .
and if possible , i will find some of the strange ones .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
you know what the answer to this question is ?
and we &apos;re so often reinventing ourselves as often as we want .
and the world that we lived in .
do you want buttons or reißverschluss ? stone or glue ?
it &apos;s also my great , personal love and fascination .
and everybody knew it was so hard , right ?
in fact , he can feel really paranormal .
she said it would be like a donnernder train train .
he finished the whole vote and did something completely new .
and suddenly , he didn &apos;t appear to be human rights .
and the proposal was to build many more kohlefabriken .
this is in our entire country of zweitgrösste abfallfluss america .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
if we repeat it , we can do a little bit more .
here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
this is actually not supposed to be a joke , but .
now , what projects do we do now ?
i think so six hundred dollars or something like that .
so , i think it &apos;s a very gelungener hack .
and this is the kernanliegen of the biohackern .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
how many doors have the house that they live in ?
the only thing that they had was their head .
and life lived in the küstenregion of british columbia .
that means you &apos;re navigierte about sounds and rhythm .
we &apos;ve been used to that things linear .
the whole thing is , i have to say .
i apologize that i must abkürzen .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s in there .
this is how it used to happen to be on the village .
and what does it look like in there ?
there &apos;s going to be a little bit of my glasses .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s familiar with this picture .
that &apos;s the time you fell in love .
so , like a human being with certain things .
we could just glide as a amorphe mollusken through the weltmeere .
if we actually don &apos;t pick up phosphorus and make .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
that means the ants weigh much more than we do .
there are still six hundred billion trees in the amazonasgebiet alone .
because the frankfurter device could be the phosphorus back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
we &apos;ve been using us now over three years .
and the oil is going to be replaced by other energy molecules .
no , it &apos;s just the right thing , yes ?
they can wegschmeißen where they go and stand .
in the countries where people come to money .
i can &apos;t play like that today in 20 years .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
according to leisezeichen , f and b , etc .
so the hammerköpfe in the piano is the sequel of my fingers .
the dauernde berieselung today with music is not förderlich .
so i wonder , how do fachlich kompetent this diagnosis ?
whether the music is too cute or too sweet .
this was the first beginning of a musical expression .
and at all , you work much less than i am .
why do i have to afford this n little car ?
and then i immediately think that &apos;s unfair .
the spanish painter picasso picasso once has a woman .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
do that once and then you experience the sentence .
we actually know that something else is the case .
the soul is something that is intellectual , about leibniz .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
because in fact , this person is not interested in evidence .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
the conventional system looks all the way around the world .
and then we started to negotiate with the insulanern .
so with investors , i &apos;ve looked for a new gesellschafter .
we can also photovoltaik zweihundert kilowatt on the web .
so , fortunately , there &apos;s also a lot of research .
this first , that was more like a passionate coup .
i had a relationship with this beauty of several months .
this futterverwertung of 2.5 to one , he said .
&quot; 2.5 to one thing ? what do you feed ? &quot;
i was eating him in a restaurant at a restaurant restaurant .
a befreundete journalist had been talked for a long time from this fish .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
i was not there for a long time ago .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely selbsterneuernd .
the other part of the belly is better the system . &quot;
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
because if the water herausfließt , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
but for many people , this is a little bit too radical .
this is not a building , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
so i &apos;m going to take a step back and take the perspective .
you do something that &apos;s a little bit different .
i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the top of the class .
this is what i think is good at the science-fiction-rolle .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t get yourself a self .
probably one of those figures must come very close to zero .
the second factor is the services that we use .
i &apos;ve left tides , geothermal , fusion and biofuels .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
there are some innovations in nuklearbereich ; modular , liquid , liquid .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
a very recent desire , that we invent this technology .
where is the greatest interest , what &apos;s really going on ?
this is a variante of one thing that was done .
those who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
specialized skills and prozessfähigkeiten and their combination lead to success .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and i took a while to figure that out .
these were umsichtige people , educated people , decent people .
that &apos;s a lot of death by measles , 20 per hour .
he befreite us from one of the worst geißeln of humanity .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
they verdunkeln their urine . they almost never do .
so we run away before , and where do we walk ?
there were no weihnachtsbäume . we did all this .
you need it , and we don &apos;t give it to you .
duke is something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s saudi .
anyway . i definitely want everyone .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my own position .
i probably know a lot of you here in the room .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo-effekt ?
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
this is my meat , and i can do that .
the first of these fall is a widerstreben complexity .
what it ruins was the memories of the experience .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
but one of them is clear than the other .
it has moments of the erlebens , one after the other .
most of you will completely ignore the erinnernden self .
the biggest difference between you is to deal with time .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
so i want you to think about a thought .
that &apos;s not about how happy one person lives .
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
now we spend three billion hours a week with online-spielen .
ok , so imagine how extreme selbstmotivierung .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
and that from an economist . so he makes sense .
and these were sort of the first of the first of people developed spielgeräte .
so , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
this is an amazing adventure that you go to .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global aussterbungs- sensibilisierungs-system , &quot; of course .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use a synonym-wörterbuch at the time .
they bring them to open up the doors .
and it was also after the three months .
how would it be to live with good health ?
is it other geltend or is it for us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
our gut is a wonderful gastfreundlichen environment for these bacteria .
i was fascinated with the elegance and beauty of biology .
the first one is we &apos;re not going to move forward .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
so just imagine two other little changes .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known among the primates .
most of my activities , i have two hüte .
and that &apos;s why the testes are in the fötalen stage testosterone .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as girls .
in our lesson , we get in all sorts of unbequemen areas .
we see that in all sorts of different domains of human life .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
i &apos;ve got something that i want to show you .
think of this as being flying , flying bildpunkt .
this would be , in ingenieurteams , call a echtzeit-kontrollsystem .
here are the results we have just gotten .
but that &apos;s a lot of unnützer and more complicated things .
did anybody see the movie &quot; butterfly &quot; ?
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
since that time we &apos;ve got all sorts of recognition .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i said , &quot; please flieg into the air . &quot;
and i feiere , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made sense for me .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i want to tell you how we found this .
these zentrifugen in iran are divided up in 15 layers .
and guess what we found in the angriffscode ?
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human being .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to ask .
you know , i had the idea of a movie .
i don &apos;t know how empfänglich people will be .
how much money is required to figure that out ?
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
so how exactly are we going to ban in the movie ?
they are so far ? they look a little nervous .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
what about me ? what about the druchschittstypen ?
this is my brand in my little , verzerrten industry .
what &apos;s next is the next thing you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
a little more about you , you &apos;re not .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with that .
a achtsame , verspielte brand . how is your brand ?

click , and wumms , you &apos;re in this museum .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called the collections .
that &apos;s the gesandten , in the nationalgallerie .
they don &apos;t even come from museums .
look , let me give you an analogy .
quantum mechanics says that unbewegliche objects are equally comfortable .
we found that it really moves really strange .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what really fantastic .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s even deeper .
now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
all parties , all the fraktionen of society , supported this .
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
it was a store called the draeger .
this business , it was almost like a vergnügungspark .
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing regalfläche .

but what happens to &quot; citizens connect &quot; is different .
turned the mülltonne on the side . went home .
this is great . this is where digital meets the physical .
let &apos;s call the tierfänger , it costs a lot of money .
so , if you could turn the light back .
in fact , we are such a mehrzellige community .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of this community .
so today evolution is happening in the period of microseconds .
so in other words , i first define what i want .
so find programs which are most likely possible .
finally , i get programs that can get numbers perfect .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities yet .
the child in me is really excited about such opportunities .
you can say things that have influence in the world .
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about power power .
she was also the starting point of many differences in our family .

a consequence of that was that the telephone was never broken .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not it . &quot;

in the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
these wires lead 13-tausend wenn when the machine runs on hochleistung .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
a remarkable statement that you can do about your work .
i &apos;d rather keep doing this work that i love .
this quest to get me into the old greece and the old rome .
the greeks called this divine diener-geister of creativity „ dämonen . .
if your work floppte -- not entirely your fault , right ?
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
but even me in my maultierart , sometimes this thing .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not making it .
but instead of getting remembered , he just stopped .
i started thinking , i should just put this project out .
i &apos;ll keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
when we start thinking about it , it changes all .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here to here .
in the andes , this glacier is the trinkwasserquelle for this city .
but if you versiegen , most of the drinking water is going to blow up .
so the alliance has created two campaigns in life .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it also smells of good .
versorge america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
so if i put them side-by-side , that makes their interest .
most of you know the most people who are familiar with this .
and then i took a sahnespender and i put it on .

then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god to virtualisieren .
and other examples are the ambienten , smart systems .
these are rooms that can respond to a human being .
so , of course , what the storytelling of course of course , and it &apos;s a computer game .
but so far , i &apos;m just going to do this little bit .
and , of course , as design impact on perception .
gestaltgesetz the nähe , the continuity of the continuity and so on .
that &apos;s then there , that comes back again .
that &apos;s exactly what the same thing i &apos;ve described .
and this is the projection of what we see , rückkopplung , seeing .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
that &apos;s the time of most perceptions that we have .

everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you put the wrong things , you have a müllproblem .
if you walk , everybody destroys the ground .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
because we don &apos;t do the things anymore .
so , as a interpretin , i first got the geschriebenen notes .
the notierten notes have the function of the letters of a copy .
the work of the interpreten begins is very much like a theaterregisseurs .
i play erklärend , which is what these notes have to mean .
i &apos;m going to take the audience &apos;s breath , consciously , or unconscious .
then the same thing happens in a good , angeregten conversation .

and then rocks auftürmt , so he &apos;ll give you the perspective .
from this time , an anecdote is talking to you .
the human being should have abstammen or have a common ancestor .
they feel that this is the actual truth behind recognition .
for this , i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled them .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum very , very many ideas .
they were all the kfa at the time called kfa .
because a good engineer has either done great cars or atomkraftanlagen .

i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
so you could feel that you could sell it .
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to take a mindset .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love .

he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensiv , not intense .
we &apos;re not realisten ; we &apos;re genießer . we &apos;re lover .
this is the one that arbeitserfahrung zurückgreift zurückgreift .
because they are the ones that are also experts for taste .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it .
you can just check it out for my talk in your rooms .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
so i can zoom in in my course in a certain degree .
but i really wanted to meet the real bear in the titanic .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
this wasn &apos;t a movie , no hd , that was real .

in fact , the set was a very precise copy of the ship &apos;s ship .
it changed my way to make films completely .
you have to be ready to take those risks .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
it &apos;s the renewables that they &apos;re often called .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the target ?
the uranium is used gradually , a bit like a candle .
a nuklearreaktor , which gives a solution to the garbage .
the fact is that these uncertainty should make us worry .

they spend most of their time in the zusammenbau structure .
konstrukteure recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of a iterativen vorgangs .
ceos are something about average , but this is what &apos;s interesting .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
so from the same , bad team of one under the best .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my todeszahl .
and soon , i was writing an article about gentechnisch food .

has one in the audience ever see anybody dying ?
no fear , no qualen , kinderlähmung , puff .
he has just developed a couple of other people .
what about kinderlähmung ? let &apos;s do that . why not ?
and we should not . our healthcare system is saudi .
and you know what my answer is all this ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
i mean , do we ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
there are no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
we can put that back in time on , what we want .
and when i go around , the finger changes its position .
i take this hand away . and here is the knife .

and my talk today is going to act of these cognitive traps .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
these are real patients who participate in painful procedure .
from the point of view itself , b was clearly a worse time .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
so , you can ask : how happy is the erlebende self ?
we know something about what happiness is meant .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how feelings vary with income .
and this is what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
my inspiration comes from an event that 2.500 for 2,500 years .
there are these ancient dimensions , from schafsknöcheln . you know ?
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
i want to say we &apos;re ready for our own personal game .

but a lot of people verfangen in a very strange position .
now in practice , people are not going to test on their chromosomes .
i mean , what does someone do with so many outfits ?
i brought up seven of them , and that &apos;s all .
and i just want to show you my outfits for this week .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
if you &apos;re happy , you get lucky people .
i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
when we grow cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .

i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
you can move around and make different kinds of experiences .
they &apos;re acting in ways with the environment and their experience .

now , in this area , there are not several thousand targets .
and neither the maschinenführer , the sicherheitssystem will notice it .
he has nothing to do with zentrifugen , with urananreicherung .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the zielreichsten environments .
now this brand , the qualcomm stadium , the staples center ...

open up the map , and jump out with a click .
they &apos;re in there , they want to go to the end of the inch .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
for example , that would be the completely logical .
now , where would you positionieren your brain on this scale ?
i don &apos;t see why it should be that way .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
they could try to expand the capacity of existing apartments .
of course , each of these issues was of course , many smaller decisions .

and that means free access , which means open and productive .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is in change .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t mean a technical definition of the platform .
if a neighbor helps the other , we create our communities .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .

and i &apos;m not sure if you really dabeibleiben .
so , in every store , you can zurückkriegen things .
so , we don &apos;t need to be klimaneutral ; we can be klimapositiv .
you study the works that he created before and after .
how were its circumstances , like the society and the politics ?
he asked me what the introduction of this ballade was for me .
when that happens , the student gets the nächstschwierige piece of play .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
the tune comes from the gesungenen and the rhythm of the dance .
that &apos;s a little bub that doesn &apos;t care about feuerlöschen .
now this is a dreisatz , which describes a logic .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
the first sentence is , klaus claims , there &apos;s no soul .
and when i &apos;m right , the kanzlerin is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the kanzlerin is not a man .

the buridansche esel is a esel that &apos;s made out of pure nature .

i worked in the breathing system for 11 years .
on this island , that &apos;s the island of graciosa on the azoren .
yeah , this is what it looks like down there .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of widerständen and arguments .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
no , not because i &apos;m a selbstgerechter genießer and gutmensch .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentiniern .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company has bought the land .
and i asked him how to become a fisch-experten .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t do your fish ? &quot;
it &apos;s the last defense ever , before something in the body .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
and who weiterforscht sees that this is particularly true in men .
but even in this eingeschränkten view , we can do a lot of things .
so i decided i was going to be there 15 , diver .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
and i fly with a little roboterfahrzeug through the ship .
we &apos;re just playing the costs . it &apos;s not a trace .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the alarm of your team is more important than all the world &apos;s lorbeer .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that go down to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
normally you seem to be wrong , and some people are not .
now , i wondered , how can i really get that out ?
now , where are we going to go , what is the right approach ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds of them .
if we go back from there , how should that reveal 2020 ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different camps .
usually , most people start to join themselves .
so i offered a $ 10000 prize prize for the winner .
and this is the value of this experience , that so simple practice .
and those of you who are interested in it can go to marshmallowchallenge.com .
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
i really believe that , and no , this is not a wunschdenken .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
you can just call some names , and people will understand .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against kinderlähmung . no way .
why ? because we don &apos;t have kinderlähmung . and you know what ?
echinacea , a little antioxidantium that helps you on the tracks .
well , i think i understand -- we hate the soviet industry .
please don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
and then people could eat the food and won &apos;t be blinded .
a deception becomes something real , because someone feels it like this .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
this is my skin . this is not a spezialeffekt from hollywood .
i know what people think when they see that .
this is really my skin . this is not a spezialeffekt from hollywood .
we &apos;ll see a couple of times in the next few days .
they were asked to report all the 60 seconds of their pain .
and what a story of a story is , is umbrüche , meaningful moments and ends .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the years .
and i don &apos;t mean just less successfully , even though that .
how can we transfer these feelings from play into reality ?
so the zusammenspielen is able to grow that from bindungen , trust and with each other .
and players love to be part of awe of awe of awe .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
it &apos;s a online-spiel where you have to overcome a ölknappheit .
and if you create it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
we degradieren a human being for our society .
ah , the majority . i like to do that as a doctor .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
if we vorausblicken , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
this is actually the true fit of human and machine .
there are 68 million people worldwide sitting in the wheelchair .
he said , &quot; koreans , you have to go to the house .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
so here we see a young female and males in a verfolgungsspiel .
just that i think it really sounds like it , right ?
so sexspiele are spreading , both with bonobos and people .
so to adapt to the world &apos;s successful world , we need to play .
as a consequence , the body develops more to the typical female course .
if the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
okay , just a quick example of a variante version .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individualismus .
and it mich me in relation to the notion of democracy .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s going on with the gründungsvätern .
and with that , they have really amazing the future civil rights system .
so how are we supposed to operationalisieren the question of the character of the character ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought in .
this is what we call in our lab , wahrnehmbares design .
halbzeit , people make a short call , go on toilets .
we can actually do the same thing with less energy .
imagine that every single one of the people being controlled .
it &apos;s a gebilde shape in london , but with bildpunkten .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
i &apos;m like , &quot; very archaisch , how can that be ? &quot;
everyone paralyzed alone can communicate alone with his eyes or draw .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempts room .
we appreciated his bed so he can see it outside .
that &apos;s keeping us on the stick and we &apos;re going to continue to develop .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a gleich right now .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
and that urgency , this goal , really changed my life .
almost like that , we &apos;re going to prepare for our lives .
i was not going to die in this day .
the gray boxes you see here , these are echtzeit-kontrollsysteme .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
and in fact , this false eingehenden data is recorded by stuxnet .
and when the risk is , then really bad things can happen .
and if you do that , eventually you get a cyber- massenvernichtungswaffe .
thank you for having us a heidenangst eingejagt . thank you ralph .
but besides , it &apos;s a very good opportunity .
and the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever . &quot;
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
and just that disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
so maybe you should get a little bit of this interview before interview . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of grautöne and stuff .
man 4 : my brand is fedex .
and what happened is that i needed an expert .
that &apos;s what i did . the first picture is a picture of my family .
i like things that are weird . i like curious things .
what is the machete ? what puppenstadium are you at the moment ?
this is actually one period of two weeks .
each one of the big spoon is called the risk .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
if the museum gave us the picture , it click .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion bildpunkte , i think .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again in new york .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
i &apos;m moving there . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
i mean , this is just what my logical side says .
so it turns out it &apos;s really hard to get rid of all of these extensions .
in the meantime , i was preparing to talk to a talk at tedglobal .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for executives .
my friends were asked to tell me , thank you , ted .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; close . &quot;
okay . everyone who is willing to take gary &apos;s offer .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and it &apos;s called &quot; swing . &quot;
they have to make 62 different decisions to create their car completely .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
when i start with the simple , i &apos;m learning how i &apos;m going .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours of video are uploaded every minute .
rebecca blacks : &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
now , we don &apos;t just find out of anything , we do .
i knew she was coming to say goodbye .
&quot; because she &apos;s been holding it tomorrow , &quot; he said .
moreover , tans &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or fifth series .
makes it possible to say how the photo was actually put together .
and yes , i have a job as you might recognize .
but where would the next thing be to help this patient ?
and they realized that the city never folded this fire down .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
this is not politically active , that &apos;s being active .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
now , why do we draw graphs in the technology on semi-logarithmischen curves ?
and that &apos;s the same thing that uses exactly the exact same letter and the same code .
so the neurons are the informationsverarbeitungsapparat , which is built these zellengemeinschaften .
the invention of language for example was a small step in this direction .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor in the verbindungsmaschine does .
now , reproduziere all the übriggebliebenen that the numbers have at best have .
and that is with a method of rekombinierens , analog to reproduction . &quot;
because all these new technologies of today are feeding themselves .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i found that technology should make magic , not killing .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the magischste thing for me .
and we bring them back to a contemporary history for children .
in another chapter , you have to fotographieren a piece of baumrinde and tag .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
it would be gewissenlos of us , consciously and gezielt people . &quot;
innovation , creativity , and development is not just from our heads .
i vertrete these kids who were very hard at strafen .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the gerichtssaal ? &quot;
during the last three decades , the verbrechensrate has declined tremendously .
this fact is often put into a context with the increased inhaftierungszahlen .
well , in fact , the number of gewaltverbrechen doesn &apos;t change very much .
the basis of a lot of these forms of technologies , and these are growing expotentiell .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
scarcity is kontextbezogen , and technology is a ressourcen force .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people .
like it was about a set of new , unprecedented voices .
how about beiträgen that we can &apos;t even predict ?
i want to close with a story that really excites me .
we are near the saisonende , and we &apos;re moving to the world cup .
that means that the player is safe for three of the 10 beats .
at that point , i was zugewiesen at the kardiologischen service .
you say that you never forget the names of those people .
i looked in the rachen and it was a little bit of pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
&quot; do you remember the patient with the gereizten rachen ? &quot;
and the fish had also been fortunate to be there .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
this shows the enormous big role that a marine reserve can play .
and the farbtöne and the -schattierungen may remind you of &quot; avatar . &quot;
because it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to have lost in some way .
and this is one of the three hauptquellen of the existing today today .

but there &apos;s a hauptunterschied : the transistor was just experts .
the idea behind littlebits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
lights , sound , solarelemente , motors -- everything should be available .
in the year 1957 , five missionare contact , and made a schwerwiegenden mistake .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of forest , which was amazing .
it will not make a bias of reality , but the resolution of reality .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new lebenmöglichkeiten .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
this is a realistischerer case . this is a copy of the guardian .
and rick szeliski of microsoft was doing research , a very good collaboration .
but the spatial orientation of the images is actually meaning .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , which was actually recorded .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us progress progress .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for themselves .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t get involved .
these organisms can get louder , they can even live in a vacuum .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
you &apos;ve seen corn , which is just a bad experiment .
it flows co2 into methane to the use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
and by getting rid of the wires , the wires just met the resistance .
i find it better if we encourage our great creative effort .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
be there for your contribution , whatever he might be .
i believe it and i feel like we should teach .
in a certain sense , the arctic eiskappe is the beating heart of our global klimasystems .
and one reason is , this enormous heat problem warms up from the north .
this austrocknung in the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
the united states is one of the two largest verschmutzer , together with china .
it &apos;s affordable and liebenswert , and workers stay in charge and bread .
we see climate change in climate change as a serious danger for our business .
versorge america with 100 percent cleaner electricity in the next 10 years .
you connect it to a certain note , and it tends to hire it .
it actually has taken eight really , really zweitausend , these networks .
so the device you see there doesn &apos;t work .
the interesting thing is , if i can make a small trip .
still we &apos;re very arrested as a informationsvermittlung , very stark .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half years .
so i &apos;ve been engaged in when , of course , what or intuitively .
the next generation of graphischen benutzungsoberflächen has been working much more with behavior .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as first .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
because the phosphorus will be emitted in the pigs over the existing ingredients .
it &apos;s safe to make sense of less harmful , which is ölverbrauch .
we do in brazil in agriculture in which we have the nutrients .
all right , we can put on this kind of nutrients in agriculture .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people very much .
a woman in germany eats about six kilograms of three kilograms in her lifetime .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re going to help , ask for people .
now there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all engage .
there &apos;s one tribe of a corporation that can be mitmachen , where everyone can come in .
the composer is becoming more and more to the friend you live with .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
you learn to find the notes on the back of the instrument .
why am i asking now by my audience that it &apos;s also listening to action ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
a piece of art you never look at , has no force .
so they &apos;re being raised in the mind that they &apos;ve been accepted in mind .
i say , ulf , what are you going to need , big car ?
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is gone .
you can try this with words like revenge or gewinnsucht or ähnlichem .
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a schönere .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s lady of worchester .
it likes to especially enjoy it because it has a tendency to the sincerity .
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
although i am at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
so i want to tell you what we &apos;ve discovered in my center .
it &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t stop by stop , physical nature .
so to lie that they can just apply this logic wrong .
but critically , if i have right , it &apos;s true .
and now our täuschendes consciousness feels immediately , and you can do something .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do with the 21st century .
if you put more windkraft together , the system starts to fail .
in the run , three of the dieseln , they &apos;re always waiting for them .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .

&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fischeiern to the birds .
oh , and by the way , they should not even be there .
it &apos;s evolved in the course of evolution to aufzusaugen aufzusaugen . &quot;
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical sterbediagramm of age .
and from here , i can go back to the side and bring them back .
and then we did that , and we managed to give a advantage for a while .
this is incredibly important . it &apos;s a good setup for marketing . &quot;
and i noticed how much these tiefseetauchgänge , a weltraummission look like this .
but i didn &apos;t mind a lot of leadership before i get that expeditions .
no self-esteem , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
and we became a big family for a period of four years .
nasa has such a lieblingssatz : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
no major endeavor , innovation was driven by no risk .
co2 warms the planet and the equation of co2 is actually pretty clear .
it turns out that if you can get it on zero .
because even though he &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
in many , you &apos;ll say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
but as they talked to different people about this world over the world .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little they serve .
if you put an exekutive administrator on the team , you get more significant .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high wetteinsätze have a strong effect ?
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
we &apos;re talking about it as ironic with little quotes : &quot; progress . &quot;
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and connection .
we love to hüllen in lies . we love that .
we hate too much government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
and that , even though none of them -- it &apos;s just zuckerpillen .
if you take flavors , you &apos;re more effective than each form .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a trick .
or , &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of both has suffered more ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the erinnrung .
end is very , very important and in this case , the end .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between engagement . we choose between experiences .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half of the time .
well , the two types of self , two words of happiness .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
this is a player on the edge of something called epischen sieges .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons .
here are the four things i found , first of all , dringlichkeits-optimismus .
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit überschwänglich .
we &apos;re putting games on the order of the real world .
they were playing a würfelspiel and the winner were allowed to break a epischen adventure .
they were playing for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute for the future .
and i hope you &apos;ll be designing with me like this and play .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of human beings .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
and the a student will get mündlich harder , and the better teachers get a mündlich .
and most importantly , that the teachers were not eingeweiht .
which would you like to have if you could only have one ?
a few . probably about as many as creative people here .
evolution priviligiert the creatures that are best in their environment .
but there &apos;s a third opportunity , an amazing , amazing and terrifying possibility .
wouldn &apos;t you want it to make these changes in your genes ?
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it lasted for 13 years .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , whose number multiplied .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of überbetont in the narrative of human evolution .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction also survive the bonobo &apos;s survival .
bonobos -- as people -- love to play their lives .
first of all , a ballspiel on bonobo-art -- and i don &apos;t think about it .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
and i had to explain the journalist that it doesn &apos;t exist .
we have two creatures , both in the middle of 1979 at the same day .
i get all my clothes out of second hand on flohmärkten and in second-hand-shops .
what &apos;s interesting today is that the echtzeit-kontrollsysteme is going to come into our lives .
well , at this night , all of you went to the center to celebrate .
and the plastic bottle we still throw away every day .
and we got the mission to design a building in the expo .
you see the person who &apos;s going to be wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
on the left side , you see the bildpunkte eindrücke sensations .
and just so , the iceberg shows you a different side of his personality .
my life is really extraordinarily blessed by work in some amazing projects .
so we have created a device that is completely free from constraints .
we set up a screenshot against a wall of the spinal ward .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you today .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and that gave us big confidence for that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t easy .
and we often ran into a dead and we had to collect ourselves .
the idea here is obviously not only that the maschinenbediener in the control room .
we need to ask the consequences , and we start to prepare ourselves .
so despite that warning , i knew anybody would buy the namensrechte .
these people are connected to the film in time -- forever .
so , my lord , you can help me ? i need help .
so , you see , with this film we wanted to tell the real version .
now i can answer all the questions and give you a ausfühliche version .
what kind of context is this thought and feelings about you ?
are you something that a little ruhiger , reservierter , conservative , conservative ?
are you built , traditionally , pflegend , beschützend , compassionate , like oprah ?
big data will be transformed in the world in large opportunities .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both sensitive or something .
but at the same time , we need a good proportion of intuition to actually do experiments .
i remember watching a kid playing on a bodenschwelle .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
they &apos;re just building the building of homes against the cities .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s take the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december in december of a hotel in december .
the other place that was very interested in urbanism is singapore .
a million people a year of latin america and traveling into the united states .
how good , do you think they are the choices ?
and we found that there was actually a context .
you know , the average supermakrt today gives you 45,000 of products .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet after next saturday .
because you just do that , if you &apos;re in order to live in sub-saharan mountain .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also freitage .
a schuluniform until the knöcheln , because she had to spend six years .
before i speak , i want to tell you about my grandmother .

to midnight midnight , the monk came , he said he had to close the coffin .

so the first rule is that microscopic photos should have the same perspective .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 follower on twitter .
and they can reach through these kinds of techniques , but also through crowdsourcing .
we know exactly where all the atm machines are around .
so , what did we do ? we did crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
they were there in february , and last february , last february .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
we now know nine cities that plan to use this app .
and not even like a technik-unternehmen , but rather like the internet itself .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started this program .
you &apos;re usually coming out of your town when you &apos;re in your town .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
this is a slide i &apos;ve chosen from my folder .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to a power in the leistungsskala .
and this is what i want to look at on the zeitskala of the earth .
this is the reason why the consistency rise to antibiotics .
we have a lot of cells that are not put on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so that allows us to work again as a unified organism .
we put a evolutionsprozess in the machine in the machine .
because your life depended on whether you did the job right .
i was in the desert in the desert with sufi-sänger mukhtiar ali .
it brings images and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
and this map grows and controls and controls in the rest of the book .
a story that introduced itself to new business , like the umweltkrise .
when i was a child , i had collections of sammlungen , stones , kieseln and muscheln .
i say that because i believe identity is very important .
i looked at her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
she said , &quot; ehrenwort ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;

we won epische epische and give people the opportunity to reach them .
so , what do we really want to do -- a disabled person or a powerful person ?
and i don &apos;t want to leave with the impact of a human being , or the hard of a human being .
and he said , &quot; well , you can &apos;t remember me .
the real meaning of worts is roots in the word &quot; educe . &quot;
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who are already looking for more creativity .
these are decisions with which their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have to be around .
so let me introduce you to now -- or the human universal load carrier .
one of the features of geschätzte kindness : somebody had taken a pair of shoes .
women , like men , have something called adrenalindrüsen .
so we have these permanent anatomischen categories that are problematic in many ways and questionable .
if all the answers said yes , i feel like i won .
a week for exactly a week , everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the gdp -- cause up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have people with our environment .
now , today , our environment begins to respond to answers .
and if we would show the people , then we can move a change change .
imagine that every one of the small donation can give you a bildpunkt .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
imagine a big explosion when they climb up at 1,000 feet .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on 1d .
and i thought of the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with windows-software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
basically it goes out to the buschehr nuclear power , and on the urananreicherungsanlage in natanz .
we need digital sicherheitssysteme where a human being can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
in my opinion , it &apos;s involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to the end .
and i would be happy to be happy to do this , to make this happen .
but is it a difficult thing for the movie or a difficult thing for me ?
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to that it &apos;s supposed to be done , something changes .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes .
part of lincoln , partially yogi , part of brooklyn-mädchen -- i don &apos;t know .
they have companies like nestle , febreze , hallmark , to discover these markenpersönlichkeit .
don &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of rollercoaster are they ?
you put it in a up-attribut ? are you a little bit of the blood in wallungen ?
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
i went close , and i realized slowly that these kids actually put something out .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be split in two camps .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play things .
he was a kleinkind and not very good at it , and he fell all the time .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great mundane objects around us .
so i made this thing in a similar way to make a computer chip .
what does it mean to vibrate at the same time and not vibrate ?
only for about 12 percent of their decisions took them an hour or more time .
today , i want to talk about one of the greatest entscheidungsprobleme of our modern time , the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem .
now , before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we did in a zeitschriftengang .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
just like &quot; double rainbow &quot; seems to be made out of nowhere .
well , tosh.0 gabelte it , many blogs started writing about it .
what &apos;s important is that creativity , which is in the internetkultur of the techies and geeks .
imagine the first piece : a man that burns his life .
the next puzzleteil shows shows like a boat in the early morgenrot morgenrot .
like most adults on the boat , my mother had a little giftflasche in himself .
so i talked about jugendarbeitslosigkeit and education , and the vernachlässigung of the marginalisierten and entrechteten .
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it goes through the women .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i still think about the boat .
because , of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
photos where you have to think a short moment to figure out the trick .
it &apos;s not about what is realistic , but what we think is realistic .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic gesundheits-projekte .
it &apos;s going to give you this little blutdruck-messgerät that you have on an iphone or something like that .
and my little startup wants us to force our environment by using ...
now -- we can skip this -- i &apos;ll just skip the video .
so he did what every good scientist would do , he wrote an app .
it has an app , a web- and handy-app , called &quot; citizens connect . &quot;
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
so these neigten are going to survive longer , and it extends into grösserem scale .
and the veranlagten these cells -- they made them happy for another billion years .
so , as an example , the raffinierteste , we know that this is the human language .
we &apos;re saying , &quot; computers , generiere a hundred million randomly randomly chosen sequences of instructions .
but one of those who might be lucky about two numbers in the right order .
we know that a entwicklungsprozess is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silberne taschenuhr .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped their view very much .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me just three things . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise . &quot;
i had what , your sister had something . go , trink a beer . &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma told all the grandchildren that they are special . &quot;
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions in the historical context .
but thinking about a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we do that . so we are so rational , so we appreciate intellect .
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
we need to make ways to provide these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started discussing .
even though aluminum 8,3 percent of the erdmasse takes it , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal .
and if we have a energieüberschuss , we &apos;ll have water in the abundance .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
but now the biggest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
and after two , three days , it was realized that she never would .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they formed the geschehenen .
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a dumb mistake ?
as you can see , the lagoon of palmen and some of the trees were umsäumt .
my third little story tells me about my mittäterschaft in southeast asia &apos;s introduction .
in one year , you get an icelandic , and then it starts with the commercial fishing .
there &apos;s a little bit of fish left , and we think that it &apos;s the normwert .
they found an article with falschem gedankengut , and they could find the creator of this thought .
the second angreifergruppe that we see today are not motivated by money .
these are the questions that we have to take over the next 50 years .
green is attachment , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wires .
add this buzzer for an extra effect , and they made a lärmmaschine .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique worm of the liedes , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
the suffering of the suffering can be 1.76 , but the erlösende mind of people &apos;s mind is a little unvergessliches .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species have existed for 600,000 years .
the gleitschienen of her sled were originally made out of fish , which was eingewickelt in karibu-haut .
this is a project called photosynth , which connects really two different technologies together .
you know , i never thought i was going to work at microsoft .
we have almost an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
and not because they &apos;re less clever , and not because they &apos;re very careful .
should i be married later ? should i have kids , or do you have career ? &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
you want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s for all the time , right ?
what could be better ? &quot; damn the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
when they came in 100 ways , they &apos;d be damn damn one of them .
and that leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
if you break the goldfischglas , that everything is possible , you get rid of happiness .
does it allow the chemistry to make this really big molecule , which has never been done before ?
it actually took some years to start with a bioethischen review before we did the first experiments .
the viral particles were then released from the cells and came back and killed e. coli .
i &apos;ve talked about the oil industry recently , and they said that this model is exactly verstünden .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the lichtmikroskop .
the elektronikindustrie had a dozen components , and you see the diversity of this .
but the same thing that we &apos;re doing right now is to use the same approaches for development .
in one of the links , between neuntausend magnets in the lhc , there was a manufakturdefekt .
the entstellt and verzerrt all of this receptor and it creates all these unerreichbaren expectations of success .
maybe an ancient understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creative return .
if you want to know how the sea level is going up , it &apos;s going to go into the ocean .
finally , the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
here i am -- this is a series that i &apos;m dealing with with a simple gleichungsprogramm .
this is a game with words , which is kind of a mixture of scrabble and boggle .
it &apos;s a story with open end and it can decide how to evolve .
and finally , i can ausblenden the whole sequence by introducing the lautstärke-siftable to the left .
so it was a curiosity and i wanted to get closer to the matter , so .
but always the approach that it should stop and be accessible .
and what are our values and what are , what is our recognition , our foundation ?
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
they have no lead-landkarten , but they used to use these songlines , or traumpfade .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from the top to b ?
and what happened is the maschinenzeitalter , and what happened is the book , and it &apos;s going to happen .
it sounds very spacig , and it sounds very , very after science fiction , i know .
you can explain that much better , because there &apos;s more a lot more behind it .
many people use the word , but they don &apos;t really mean what it means .
it &apos;s important for the creator , the first semester , the great gestaltgesetze .
it sounds very banal , but it &apos;s kind of interesting , if you &apos;re going to get closer to it .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s really first .
there is a practical function of practical functions , so formale aspects , or formalästhetische aspects .
this has been a lot more sophisticated , but it &apos;s also much better .
that means we &apos;re losing over five thousand times more than new ones .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back into cycles .
you know , there are two countries that control nearly 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
at every point where you &apos;re wegwirft , you &apos;re going to go back .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that it will take you through the scratch of the biodiversity .
a television or a washing machine , they just use it , they don &apos;t use them .
i said yes , you need about the same as the spoken language .
well , you can see , in all cases , nobody has to be a aussichtsloser candidate .
or that , what i &apos;m talking about today , because what you might have thought .
why do we need to prevent that people know about something when it &apos;s true ?
but we know if we do that , the social division is very sensitive .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that should work .
so we should be able to think of them as something which is necessarily supposed to be present for our lives .
so the second sentence is , if klaus is right , it has no soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , which is dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
and i brought to you a project that i want to give you now .
you can only , of course , if you &apos;re able to power in some way .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s wrong with a normal , stinknormalen battery .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild a society .
and that means we &apos;ve then begun to find the greatest battery in the world .
it &apos;s not , it &apos;s insanity , kinderspielkram , you know , we &apos;re going to give up .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a autarkes system .
and the reality of this expression is reaching all of us , and it &apos;s moving , inspired and united .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve gone out of the ocean as we have polluted potatoes .
well , he mentioned some algae and some fischmehle , and then he said , hühnchen-pellets .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds .
now last year , there were 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
he said , &quot; no . you do it because the food is better . &quot;
so i want to do this idea a little bit more about what a little bit crazy .
the summary is a short overview , and a symbol of the area that comes from it .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
so we went in &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot more .
so i shifted that and made this other film about the big ship that goes down .
and the preparation of that were enormous . we had to build cameras and house and all kinds of things .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do here ?
i asked the top-wissenschaftler several times , &quot; do we really get down to zero ?
it &apos;s all that we eat , the food we eat , clothing , heating .
usually there is no deadline that you need a miracle to a specific date .
but in this case , we have to get vollgas and get a miracle in a very short time .
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that the idea of people here ?
and i decided that this would give me the freilassen contribution to the environment here .
well , there are all kinds of spielereilösungen like this , but they don &apos;t get much .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning by either coal or natural gas .
one is the energy density that makes these technologies dramatically lower than the kraftwerken .
instead of breaking the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
if countries are meeting in places like koppenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
klimaskeptiker : do you have one or two sentences to convince you maybe ?
you talk about it , you think it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to make power .
and that is that bwl-studenten were trained to find a proper plan , ok !
it &apos;s amazing . you can see , and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
if anyone built a 2,5cm high construction , he would have carried the price home .
and the basale lesson , i think , is actually a verbindender sport .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and not because i &apos;m a researcher .
it &apos;s because possibilities don &apos;t go back on this planet , they go forward .
i think we can power the world with energy that they don &apos;t burn at the same time .
it &apos;s not happening in this country at all , but 160.000 in the world &apos;s last year .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and it &apos;s seelentötend itself that can afford it .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this verrottete stuff , like maniok .
but this is actually not the point here , and then i open my hand .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a scientist , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me .
and people at the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen that right . &quot;
and then he added , really quite emotional , that has ruined all the experience .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per person .
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments in life &apos;s life ?
just to give you a sense of correlation , which correlation is about .5 .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
i &apos;ve calculated that the time required for 21 billion hours per week .
oh , you know that . ok . great . so we have some players here .
this is me , like i am in life , i &apos;m bad .
why is it possible in games to think , you can &apos;t just reach everything ?
and players are always ready to work , if they get the right task .
the second secret of the world , with almost 80,000 einträgen , is the world of warcraft .
we &apos;re working with universities all over sub-saharan africa , and they &apos;re going to learn a social framework .

they say that all things that are shown up there will follow a life cycle .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
and then he said three words -- the emotionslosesten words i &apos;ve ever heard .
because when the wine is there , and the person is there , then i open it .
while we abstürzen , i had this feeling , man , to die , is not terrifying .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be met by stuxnet .
so , for example , he would work exactly as well -- in a power station or in a power station .
there &apos;s only one and this is the united states -- fortunately , luckily .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller films , we &apos;re a brand herausforderer .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three times .
i think if you lose people from it , you get them closer to failure .

and so they all wrote these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
so if you think about it , it &apos;s basically where we are today .
you already have a baugrundstück , and you think of this area for the second city .
one thing that you already know was already , there &apos;s a lot of mieter .
or even duzende from these cities to build , or have hundreds of cities around the world ?
and then we looked at what the people were going to buy a glass of glass .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even if it &apos;s against our own best interests .
and if your employees don &apos;t auseinanderhalten them , they can &apos;t do their customers . &quot;
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that make them a decision .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order of the choices that make decisions .
who could have predicted &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or nyan cat ?
two paar for school , for the school , to cover the holes in the other .
in one , i was the classic asian student , the unerbittliche demands of himself .
and i was going to be the next katapultiert , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
at the end of each one , i ended up cooking a giant soup of soup that we shared .
but if i could give that , and you could safely durchbringen it , i would do it .

this is a generation that grew up to see their voice as granted .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the government of government .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosionsartigen curve .
and it makes it partly with methods that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .

this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , of the genome phi 174 .
we made little pieces , and we made a dna molecule and a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the fehlerrate at one mistake per 10,000 base base .
think about it : we have a 4-buchstaben code code : a , c , g and t.
the chromosome that was in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes we put on it .
and then , of course , there is all the co2 coming from this stuff that goes into the atmosphere .
we &apos;re going to put in the first line here in the limits of the biological reality and our imagination .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .

in holland , of course , that &apos;s easier , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
so , it &apos;s about creating a large footprint that becomes a feuchtgebiet .
so no longer saving , avoid , avoid , reducing , not schuldmanagement , but intelligent waste .
so for the learning process of music , you need to have at least as long as the spoken language .
now for me and for the composers , and what they might now mean for him today .

in the matheunterricht , i was always caught by the teacher , like i am hidden in the textbook .

well , by arthur clarke &apos;s law , he may not be fortgeschrittliche technology and magic and magic .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s necessarily going to have to be involved in the filmkunst . &quot;
and then we began to set up the &quot; bismarck , &quot; and we explored them with roboterfahrzeugen .
but at the end , it went out that i took weltraumwissenschaftler with us into the deep sea .
i remembered the last year when i got mosquitos and somehow liked the people .
these are energiefarmen , you talk about many quadratkilometern , 1,000 times more surface than a regular power station .
i think there are a lot of people in the ted group who have already been engaged there .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , perhaps surprisingly , will follow nuclear approach .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is kind of the deadline that shows us the umweltmodelle that we have to extract .
it would have been , without the umweltherausforderung , but it &apos;s much more important .
then they invest a little bit of time planning and organization , and they skizzieren and put spaghetti muscle out .
what you might be asking is : how is this ? why ? what about ?
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to trash this world .
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
you take it back , you return the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
hundreds of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of deaths in a country that is getting worse than any other of this disease .
nothing goes into my sleeve or comes out , no trickserei , and you can study everything .
one year ago , i read a study that really blew me up .
and just a little bit of a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
sorry . if you &apos;re miserable , look away , don &apos;t look .
and it really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts to start .
and none of these stories are very erbaulich or great -- but one of them is clear ...
so we have the erinnernde self and the erlebende self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future is the opposite .
he wanted to capture the feelings in games , so he built a camera in front of the players .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
you &apos;re not sitting around , and you &apos;re däumchen . there &apos;s always something important to do .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are meister-spieler .
these are our meister-spieler , 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at &quot; something . &quot;
and then the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
this was the first strategiespiel in real time in the world of warcraft-serie , which was 16 years ago .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we describe with these words .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
so we have to look beyond the patologie and focus on all the field of human possibilities .
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , in the u.k. , there was been a prime case .
if a mind is about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new daseinsformen .
and you &apos;re all going to give you all the nutrients that you could just be able to do without effort .
and the argument , here is that the wheels of evolution are slow , but they are unerbittlich .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
soldier : with the hulc-exoskelett , i can carry 200 pounds on verschiedenartiges terrain for hours .
we &apos;re so far , with our industriepartner , this device , to introduce this new exoskelett in this year .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the ceo of a non-profit called robin hood .
for us and she &apos;s game game , it &apos;s essential to the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight the question , when someone was dead .
and to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought about it .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but what they did for us was great .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
beyond cities , all of this sense and drive all of this sense and drive into objects of everyday life .
well , all our objects , our environment , start to speak back to us .
now , i should tell you what happened at night when all the sensors stopped working .
so here you see a real flyfire-steuerung , the herabsinkt around how previously a gleichmäßiges v .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever elected farmers .
i could see it in their eyes , there was horror , life was too close .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i &apos;m not trying to have more , right ; i &apos;m afraid to be happy .
about a month after that , i went to a point of my daughter -- erstklässler , not a lot of künstlerisches talent ...
and more than anything else , are you the best parents you can possibly be ?

either &quot; floral fusion &quot; or &quot; paradise winds , &quot; they &apos;ll have the choice .
i have to talk to the guy on the street that are like me , otto-normal-verbraucher .
but i usually have a accessoire , like sonnenbrillen , or a jewelry , like that .
and i think some companies are only going to focus on a strength , instead of both .
if someone asked them to describe their markenidentität , their markenpersönlichkeit , how would they be ?
when i went to visit and visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
there &apos;s the uffizi , the moma , the hermitage , the rijks , the van gogh .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite classes until i &apos;m really in the rissen .
this is the first object you can see that was in the quantenmechanischen .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be thinking about how to think about economic development .
so we could be very simple in the world with duzenden , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now , this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
and i &apos;ve come to the kernaussage that a new city offers new possibilities .
and they &apos;ve found that an average ceo is going on the week with 139 tasks .
and this is a problem that you often see when you look at the long bullet points .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends-manager at youtube , and i &apos;m looking at youtube-videos .
as i said , one of the right stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning in youtube .
after a four and a half vierjährigen , glitt glitt glitt boot a boat on the lake , fischerboot .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in footscray and sat around her coffin .
you might think that this is just a landschaftsbild , and the bottom part is being manipulated .
so to achieve a realistisches outcome , it comes from me to the planning .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that fellows have written in the last year .
and chicago has just introduced it to the people who are freischaufeln , when it comes out .
this is the work very smart people in the new urban community in boston .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is getting into the editing .
and most people understand this , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
you can make your opinion , on every channel at any time , and you do .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather about the general form .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is available forever as fast as it is now available .
because the transition appears very , very confusing to be in the middle of it .
and i think the reason for this is that we realize that there is something going on .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace your dna .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
then the nächstens steps , like language and so on , dauerten less than a million years .
it gets faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
i think it &apos;s very hochmütig from us to say that we are the final of evolution .
when we wanted to travel , we went into a car and we went across the sky .
and so -- here &apos;s the box , &quot; this box , &quot; i &apos;m saying , &quot; i &apos;m writing my name .
she pulled me so hard that i could barely breathe . then she took me off .
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , that you &apos;re going to love your mom forever . &quot;
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m teaching my students african-american story . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with this . &quot;
and yet , in our country , there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
every second every second , our senses is a lot more information than our brain can ever process .
so if we look at the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and that &apos;s because the ernährungs- , elektrizitäts- transport- and costs have been reduced to a pair of glasses .
steve pinker showed us that we currently live in a very peaceful period of life .
i &apos;ve been looking at the newspapers and looking for the best headlines i could find .
imagine that this artificial intelligence has been available to every owner of a mobiltelefones .
aluminum was at this time the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platin .
and to win , this device has to be a better diagnosis than a team of physicians .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the menschengemeinde us ?
and it turns out that today the human pattern recognition is better than the best supercomputer .
and it was my assignment when the notfallpersonal was looking at the rat advice .
and over a period of time from one to two hours , they started feeling better .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you sick .
when did you hear the last time of somebody talking about fehlschlag via fehlschlag over fehlschlag ?
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
and i got an awful sonnenbrand , and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t there .
when i returned to 27 years later , the fish was reduced to half its size .
there are several known cases of online-millionären , multimillionären , which made their money through attacks .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , one opinion , or by their audience .
so western governments power governments with hilfsmitteln , so that they can use their own citizens .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a specific culture will find access to the material world .
in a blutbefleckten continent , these people were the only ones who had never conquered the spaniern .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the suffering if you haven &apos;t experienced it on unterster flat .
if we ask these myriad weltkulturen to the importance of human beings , they end up with 10,000 different voices .
the family , the fear of his life , he took all the guns and all the tools .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve anything .
and this really reaches these ideas , these limitations for the available place in the screen .
we hope that this is not a pop-ups and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
something like this is how our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; and not what they did .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did before .
there &apos;s , by the way , a corner i &apos;m not going to tell you about .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
you want to cut down too far , kegelig , blah , blah blah , blah , and so on .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
this is almost with perfect security , potentially , for the fish , definitely for us .
now i &apos;ve argued that this is not the genesis -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
we have technologies today because of this rapid synthesemethoden to do what we call genetics genetics .
we now have the ability to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very far away , you &apos;re going to be sogenannten .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about that , and i ask myself , why ?
this is -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of körperlosem creative spirit , a „ genius .
this is great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
she felt when it came , because it would take the earth under their feet .
so i took my look at the manuscript and i talked to my comment towards an empty corner of the room .
so if you want to get it better , you have to pop up here and drive your share .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the hell .
but once again , very rare , something special happened . one of the performer was actually überweltlich .
and the disasters all over the world have in a really meaningful and previously unprecedented extent .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to take us out of this misslichen .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can put in any patterns .
i can speed up the entire sequence by turning the pace into one or another .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan to do it in front of the way , but it can be calculated ; it &apos;s constantly extending or verkürzen .
there are now craig venter in the u.s.a , who tries to make biofuel , so gas from algae .
and our approach was just to say , o.k , that actually , you don &apos;t have to do that .
and the commercial device costs about 15,000 dollars or something like that , sahnespender about 50 .
now , what is this now with virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
schamanen , priests , so-called wissenswächter , were extra abgestellt to keep knowledge in stories .
virtuality suddenly has become alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality .
and those are over the centuries of the centuries of more and more powerful than the jahrhunderte of the maschinenzeitalters .
but this is a essential critical component , if you want to create things like this as well as you might be familiar with things .
i &apos;ve got such cognitive rückkoppelung , you know , you have what you want to see .
that i &apos;m just making it different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better .
but also , that leads to me , when are things going to be more intuitive ?
and this is for us humans always , if i &apos;m going to have to think very little about it .
now , i can see this mental handlungsmodell , orientieren , informieren , informieren , informieren , informieren , informieren .
they could easily altöl a liter of altöl , and then it would ruin over years .
unfortunately , not in offenbach , but maybe you can help the frankfurtern a little bit .
this is the first green backpack , actually , which is to go back into the circulation .
or d , you don &apos;t like music , you don &apos;t want to do it , you don &apos;t want to do it .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of man .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about a student .
a third sentence that comes immediately to people who have a strong sense of a soul .
so , we do as if it &apos;s actually impossible to be able to live without a soul .
in the presence of about , in the present , we have a very modern example , which keeps the tageszeitungen .
there was a neurologist who was called johannes buridanus and after the buridansche named esel .
but not , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is physically seen the european .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney concert hall .
it was a beautiful fish , wohlschmeckend , good konsistenz , a bestseller on the menu .
and this evening , i was in bed , and i thought , what hell is a sustainable protein ?
and here , here he looks at a pattern of circles that reminds him to the tansanische giraffe .
and then he goes and falls into more talks of rare birds and algae and strange wasserpflanzen .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the photoreceptors , the relationships , is incredible .
the pflanzliche biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
we love wochenmärkte . we love little familienbetriebe . we talk about local food . we eat organic food .
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed themselves ?
capital , chemistry and machines are in there , and it never has something really good for food .
it &apos;s something in between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
this is really important , because this is a realization that is not in a single wikipediaseite .
if we can do that , then this bisherige , maybe a new source of information .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the boundaries of the potential .
certainly i would never reach a alien world with a spaceship , which seemed quite unlikely to me .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , unlike our own , kläglichen human imagination .
in &quot; abyss , &quot; i could take my predilection for the unterwasserwelt and to connect with the filmemachen .
what came out of this was the first computergenerierte soft-surface-figur ever seen in a movie .
sounds crazy . but again , that &apos;s the fact that your imagination can create a reality .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as though i &apos;m in a science-fiction-film .
so let &apos;s look at every element , and we think about how we get it on zero .
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their schulaufgaben .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s manure as antriebsstoff .
you see , it &apos;s a kind of a column , often known as &quot; wandernde wave reactor . &quot;
we need marktanreize , carbon taxes , cap &amp; amp ; trade is something that creates a preissignal .
we need to turn into dialogue and lead to complete and also the things that are done by government .
and it would be best if there were several , because then you could use a mixture .
there &apos;s a liquid reaktortyp , which seems to be difficult , but maybe they say that .
and peter says , &quot; no one of the kids invested in the boss to be gmbh . &quot;
and that team , which is filling down and on the work , is going to improve the performance of the team .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or the candidate , to build the right prototype .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics who were getting me crazy at all did not even .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same .
i know that they did that because half the americans make it every day .
it doesn &apos;t have any nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are building all this .
so let &apos;s also understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple trick .
this creates a very strong picture . it &apos;s a lot stronger than a white pill .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both zusammengeworfen in the idea of happiness .
and the surprise is that patients had a much worse erinnrung to the darmspiegelung .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future as a experiences .
but danny , in the entire american arts , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
that is , i think , in the next one or two decades , of the national statistics .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the world &apos;s most desperately problems .
we never have these feelings when we play games , they just don &apos;t play them .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; überflieger , &quot; read .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what the most significant people in the world .
because if we could figure that out , we would never have a very gewesenes human potential .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we know that as human beings , we are optimal , when we do hard , meaningful work .
nobody wants to change their life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
so , for the next weltrettende game , we have a bigger higher destination than just ölknappheit .
the call to player , to sign up , is almost designed like a &quot; jerry-bruckheimer . &quot;
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when you google &quot; superstruct . &quot;
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies and was just designed to work with kids as well .
this is just one example of many , how adults can leverage the imagination of a child .
our language hinkt the social changes in many cases that has been triggered by a technological change .
widrigkeiten is not a obstacle that we have to have to be able to do better with our lives .
and maybe we know what wood we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re really tested .
and i &apos;m looking around and seeing this older man . i had no idea who he is .
when i first saw her , i took her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
you can simply &apos;t emphasize enough how critical this factor can be for the quality of a human being .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite these experiences .
they call this &quot; streaming trials &quot; in the united states as &quot; tracking . &quot;
it wasn &apos;t necessarily the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
let &apos;s first look at reality that people are making decisions today in some cultures about their offspring .
why not have the fast muskelfasern that allow them to run faster and longer ?
his flexible design enables it to go deep to hocken , to kriechen and highly wendige movements .
i was 24 years old , and in bestform , as a monströser purzelbaum while i was paralysierte .
i was the second volunteer at brandstelle , so i had quite good opportunities to get there .
as chimpanzees of large , scared einflößenden kerlen , the bonobo-gesellschaft of ermächtigten female is led .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain species of anatomical resonance related to a particular identity .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out to be much more complicated than ours .
what do we want to do with the fact that we are merely different from a few nukleotide ?
now , you might think that the whole thing is going to be free from categories like me .
and for example , if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and god of nature .
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
and if you think they &apos;re not good at something , they &apos;re probably right .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of predicting our environment and power .
so the first project i &apos;d like to introduce to you is actually one of the first of our lab .
if these bildpunkte fall down , they can write , you can write patterns , pictures , text .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formaten or sizes , in different ways .
my heart sped , i was schwindelig , while i was trying to grab what was wrong with me .
part of the ice in the eisbergen that i &apos;m very young -- a few thousand years old .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to verbannen negative energy from my life .
i don &apos;t want that this thing breaks in 20 parts , as you know it from a documentary .
and that sadness really formierte into a thought , which is that i &apos;m just one thing .
what would you do , which you tweet , because you think you &apos;d be there forever ?
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart from this code .
so , it was possible for us to bring the little digital sprengkopf with the rotorsteuerung .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , these black object that you see .
so , for example , the number of 164 is very out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
so we might sell a shoe , and he &apos;ll be the greatest shoe that they &apos;ve ever carried ...
who knows when the movie comes out , we might look like a horde vollidioten .
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this strange bear , still brüllt .
the brand i am , i would say , i would say , lässige fly .
and you can see it here too , target , wii , mini von and jetblue .
well , because the movie at the time film was festival , we could see that .
if we had a scale to measure the aptitute of every hemisphere , we could share your brain .
that &apos;s not what my intuition was like , and maybe because i don &apos;t play too much with particles .
so what is it for an idea about making a completely new city ?
and also recently , a study of ceos that they had been watching the ceo for a week .
the more possibilities available to them , the more they put their money in pure geldmarktkonten .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know what to do .
here &apos;s a german autohersteller , which gives you the opportunity to konfigurieren your car completely .
last year , bear vasquez vasquez this video that he photographed in the financial national park .
this chart shows how it was as popular as the video last summer for the first time .
because tastemaker like jimmy kimmel represent new and interesting things and show them a big audience .
michael j. nelson from the mystery science theater was a first one that made a joke on twitter .
in a gefangennahme , they would have my sister and i would drink them and my grandmother .
and because of these help , i was in my last year of jurastudiums as a young australierin of the year .
there was a energy , a unerbittlichen optimism , a strange mixtur of humility and the wagnisses .
i just put in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
and these two images fulfill these two demands -- from the same altitude and the same beleuchtungsart .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced at the university was to take a haupt-zuhörer .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like the friedenscorps for geeks .
if you do that , you can give it a name , and he called the first al .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but she doesn &apos;t complain about it , they fix them .
i &apos;m rather talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
this is because the government is like an ocean , and politics is the top 15cm .
this could be a fire fire freizuschaufeln , unkraut unkraut , a trash stream with a beutelratte flip .
it &apos;s really , it means , we &apos;re right now in the middle of a transition .
so i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are right now .
we are so far that we can write , just to be able to write in this code .
and they developed special structures , which made nothing different than information in the organism .
the first steps of history , which i told you , is a billion years a piece .

i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my physiotherapie .
but most importantly , it &apos;s among the perception of our subdivisions and our great erfindergeist , a connection .
maybe that &apos;s exactly the point of mind , a sense of ichs , a sense of our own power .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
the human part of this busches , far at the end is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
i mean , do you think , if antonio damasio asks you to think about the bacteria ?
it &apos;s really a lighter way for bacteria , with gelegentlichen unterbrechungen of the unintended , jeodch stoß .
but , you know , you &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just like you &apos;re important for your life .
or are we determined to become something else -- something that might be better at the environment ?
do we use these decisions to shape a society better , which is better , the more friendly ?
now let &apos;s look at our view of the rollstuhlfahrer , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since his , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
you have to go up , the fire , and you have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i was wearing my prey down to the bottom , where i met my erzfeind and the beloved dog .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
and if you watch bonobos in play , you see the evolutionary origins of human lachens , dance , dance and rituals .
and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i know they were rassisiten , i know they were sexisten , but they were great .
the masters of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the geburtsrechts .
heinrich , on the other hand , is born for the geburtstermin , so he was born on march .
heinrich can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman today .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i &apos;ve been telling you about the androgenrezeptor-defekt .
this is from an exhibition , paola antonelli for moma in the year , while the summer , organized .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , on the garbage glue and started tracking it .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even let the roof down .
now , here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical bildpunkten , the bildpunkten of water and the projection .
and this is what made us think about this project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
if you turn the lights on it , it looks like this . so , as we saw before .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we also had to put in the parking lot in the parking room , so we felt like a part of the sprüher-szene .
so basically , i &apos;m about this : if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it .
well , one of the enlightenment is usually something you find because you &apos;ve left it anywhere .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often mentioned here .
and i bedauerte the time that i wasted bedeutungslose things , with people who are doing something .
ralph , it was reported a lot of it that people assume that the mossad is the hauptorganisation .
some of you may have heard that i took a display in ebay a few weeks ago .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatalen mistake , and that was the one .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
and we went to schulbezirke , which companies are moving their way into verarmte schools in all america .
i &apos;m probably going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
they can go and create their own museum online -- from all these images you can put their own collection .
i went a clean space with new siliziumscheiben , and rackerte for 100 hours of all the big equipment .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today that much more .
half of the customers are going to go from the many possibilities , 56 autofarben to the low possibilities , four gears .
and this is the very surprising and humorvoll , and it was casey idee , and his argument 5 million times .
for them , the life had a job , the escape of your family and a new life in australia .
unlike in the alteingesessenen , whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no anspruchsdenken .
and the fetzen broken englischs were between people who had one thing in common : they started new .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we made the breakthrough .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you squeeze on the trigger .
so i wanted to create something else , something that &apos;s going on when the trigger continues .
we have three perfect objects here , where we can all identify ourselves in a three-dimensional world .
so we überlisten our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t really make sure it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
so i would say there &apos;s three simple rules to follow , to achieve a realistisches outcome .
one of the most important things is we need to think about it , is that government is not the same thing as politics .
and this is a neuheit that we have to use this guy in semi-logarithmischen curves in the field of technology .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition of the middle world , a new kind of world .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same notation .
and i have 100 mikrogramm of a white pulvers , which i want to keep in airports from sicherheitspersonal .
at this point we have mehrzellige communities , communities from many verschiedlichen zellentypen , which together act as a single organism .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a process , which is very different from the classical ingenieurswesen .
we &apos;re at a point where the analog is at the time , as einzeller-organismen evolved .
now , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to listen to you here before i &apos;m still going .
we would never fly anyone with an airplane if for nine planes that pop open , one crash .
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe , also , for the sake of it .
my goodness , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent of mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
and only by the way , the biggest absicherung against a population population is a better education and nutrition in the world .
&quot; moneyball &quot; seems soon and turns around statistics and to use this great baseball team .
i was residierte on a lehrkrankenhaus here in toronto as a woman &apos;s wife in the hospital &apos;s office .
two days later , i came to my next notfalldienst , and my chefärztin asked me to do a conversation in her office .
in a krankenhaussystem where the medical knowledge has doubled every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
we &apos;ve heard this story many times from the galapagos or other places , and it &apos;s not very special .
fischförderung called countries who have already started 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing of this kind of ugly ship .
the reason is going to change . in this case -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals will be matschiger .
with the time , it changes . it changes because for the people who are , of course .
we want to get things that disappeared or things that are no longer like they were .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
to this day , they &apos;re going to be governed by a ritual priesthood , but it &apos;s very extraordinary .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard of , the most powerful präparat reduction from the repertoire of the schamanen .
now you have to know that the inuit have no fear from the cold . they used them to their advantage .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the fülle information that have a lot of these images .
they provide 50 percent reduction -- 10 percent less employees , as if they would only offer five . why ?
and these other things like many attractive traits , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
it may sound like genomic alchimie , but we can , by changing the software-dna , things quite dramatic .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look . we know exactly how their genetic code will look .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first ones with the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
i &apos;m working on this . he &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 meters in the width , 22 meters in diameter .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanismus , and people started to believe that creativity was completely dependent on their own individual .
she caught the poem on his tail and pulled it back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
when i heard that , i thought that this is kind of weird -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going to happen .
even i had work or ideas that made out of a source through me that i can &apos;t identify .
because you see that i have everything i have , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
but this doesn &apos;t push very much enough of the seriousness of this particular thing , because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
this is called dauereis , five years old or older , almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
the red thread that all connects to this is our dependence on kohlenstoff-basierenden kraftstoffen like dirty coal and ausländisches oil .
he can bring new characters into the scene by aufhebt the siftable from the table that shows this character .
and that &apos;s the software-hacker , the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and that &apos;s not in the hobbybereich , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do a lot .
gene-gun is , yes , like a kind of luftdruckpistole , that shoots about this as far , two inches or something .
that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to answer to you immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen right now .
in this mind , knowledge abgerufen , and with this virtual images , the imagination , the imagination was also passed to know .
maybe you &apos;ll stand up for a minute so you can be able to do the two of the project .
and that &apos;s actually what i thought is that i discover the outside world , so i find the real world again .
not if i think of local current , and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
and what does , of course , means , of course , intuitively and how do our channels of perception and how does the cognitive process work ?
we &apos;re more likely to be on the symbolischen , on the bedeutungsebene , with which we are , of course , as a creator .
and that &apos;s on a higher grail of the benutzungsfreundlichkeit than the transmission of a classical metaphor , which is the desktops .
so all western rich rich are always expanding until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re implodiert .
you think that the composer in the notes has everything that he had imagined .
his cause to write the piece is becoming more and more and more and more personal .
i think the stream would be enthusiastic if he had had the klanglichen possibilities of modern modern klaviere .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is doing it , that they deceive themselves .
so here you have this mechanism that we can use as a great invention to use our lebensverhältnisse .
we need this lie that this lie , which is the deception that we can &apos;t eat .
that the person from the monkey should , and , yes , there would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
but there &apos;s no clubs that we can look at , where you &apos;re learning how to do fire .
he &apos;s only interested in having himself freizuhalten the need to prove that there are vorhersager .
i have to say , you &apos;ve got it , you know , it &apos;s hard to talk to me at the beginning of my idea .
the igbo is back-up , and the wind , sun control the load so that they can map the larger percentage .
that means that , at the moment , you have to worry that renewables can take the whole net .
this is in little style , so you can also use the car &apos;s car on a little bit .
but if you want to have multiple of these wechselrichtern , and you want to build a web , it will be very complicated .
and to this point , people are always going to come and look at our versuchsstand on our own .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you get a piece of the future ?
because the music allows him to , his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
they built this complicated episode of canals , and they pulled out water from the land and out into the river .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they have the logic of our nahrungssystems for the last 50 years .
you know , that &apos;s right , because when the future is good food , it will be delicious .
my response to that was drawing and painting from aliens , alien worlds , robots , robots and all that .
from those two experiences , a whole new world of creativity has reached a whole new world of creativity for filmschaffende .
so the circle between my existence , as a child , as a child , and the practice in reality .
there were people who thought we were really good at destroying these ozeanwesen , and on the planet .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david mckays &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
i mean , every one of us here might spend five times as much for our energy , without changing its lifestyle .
and , although it really seems , it &apos;s really really hard to work , because it forces people to work very quickly .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
so the performance is working with prototypes , a lot -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
in the rich world , diseases exist from us only one generation , hardly yet .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about sociology for &quot; the new yorker &quot; a little article .
but i was worried about this article , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it .
one of the reasons i wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said i &apos;m a little too schrill .
this is the planet we live on . don &apos;t do that as if it &apos;s not .
everything that we eat , every reiskorn , every branch , every rosenkohl , was changed by the people .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our beharren on higher food , better food .
we can hinbewegen them where we want them to go , and we &apos;ll move them into where we want .
a colored capsule , which is yellow at the end and on the other red , is better than a white capsule .
perhaps too much time , if you think about how many problems we really have in the real world .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel besiegt . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or zynisch .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level in the game , right ?
we don &apos;t have that in life so easily , that sense that a lot of employees are willing to stand .
there &apos;s also this epic story , which is inspiring history , why we are there and what we have to do .
you &apos;ve heard about &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; or &quot; + 1 . &quot;
until today , all the world of warcraft-spieler have spent millions of years trying to solve the virtual problems of azeroth .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome : players are super-mächtige , hopeful individuals .
and the only problem is they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real ones .
one person who opened doors to me was my pediatrician at the a.i. dupont institute in wilmington delaware .
and we don &apos;t really like our kids when we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
and of course , it breaks a heart to hear that vice versa was said , they were just enough .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
we put our estimates out to the hausbesitzerin , where , not surprisingly , it got more attention than my own .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the lives of another , until they reach their first million .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a verborgenes laugh out of the trees .
i think , just like you &apos;re playing , sometimes , and we &apos;re loten boundaries of our inner and the outer worlds .
and in the other case , the sperm carries x chromosome , which hits the x of the eizelle .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to testosterone .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we are taking people lebenswichtige organs and putting them in other people .
i &apos;m political progressiv , i &apos;m verteidige people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
now they made this part because they were part of a aufklärerischen system in which two things are common together .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5-jährige should have the right to get your informed consent or to get married .
and i told him , &quot; well , did you think of political asyl , rather than a surgery ? &quot;
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you will appreciate it also .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a spürenden part and a reagierendenteil .
now look at what happened this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
all the kids from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
it could have every single impulse that could have a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or something .
so the idea is that , in fact , we &apos;re actually giving people to connect things together .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to , like london new berggipfel .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are separate from nature and that everything is connected .
it starts with the tags , then the schimpfwörter , then the schimpfwörter , and the final people are actually doing art .
my circle began in the &apos; 60s at high school in stow , ohio , where i was the klassenschwuchtel .
and i should say i &apos;ve got bauspeicheldrüsenkrebs , and i want you to be a seat . &quot;
while i was thinking about it later , a saying that , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad wines . &quot;
the nutzdaten will go pass into the gray box , damage the centrifuge and the iranian kernenergie-programm -- mission accomplished .
verhielt verhielt verhielt , who didn &apos;t like our cheese -- schnüffelte , but didn &apos;t eat him .
and after we discovered with different kinds of cheese , i went to realize that this is a gezielter attack .
so , in and large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywoodfilmen , which is the verfolgungsjagd , where the verfolgungsjagd is fed by before .
and every time i put somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
a lot of spaßiger negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
those of you who are really interested in art can click -- but i click this way away .
i think finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things are not coming from google .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re just going to represent this digital medium of art and represent them properly online .
this was the physics of a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
so , imagine that you were at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much worth building as it costs them .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they are .
this is a picture of a large , new urban center that built in south korea in south korea , major than the urban bostons .
well , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
and so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that people offered anything between two to 59 different fund .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of entscheidungsüberlastung , it &apos;s the konkretisierung .
the other half of the customers go from the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 autofarben , lots of possibilities .
there was a meeting on reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
she reminded me that i was so old , as she was then , when we climb the boat .
and even though i had my degree , i realized i couldn &apos;t deal with a career in law .
she grew up at a time where the social norm and the local students was the most important person .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of your mind so cold ? &quot;
so for me , photography seemed to be really about being in the right place at the right time .
and yes , i even have the house up on the island of red umgefärbt to make it look 33 .
and i think that the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
make ways that they are easy to use and start to hug patients in the team .
and then i decided to use seattle , to use the app to get the citizens to clean the gullys .
it was about a method that the parents could find out the right public schools for their children .
and as many people , i thought it was mainly about choosing people in office .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we all fight , which is to talk about who they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic s-kurve like this , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
in any way that we don &apos;t even understand , these tröpfchen have learned the ability to niederzuschreiben information .
if i was in fact , i would have been a egoist , then i &apos;d put it on a virus and open it into the room .
now this communication allowed the reasons of communities that were in some sense in the same boat ; they were synergetisch .
let &apos;s say , i want to share numbers that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for that .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write by hand .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single murmel .
we &apos;ve all heard of feen and nymphen , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
and sometimes when something comes over ted , it gets a meaning and the force that otherwise doesn &apos;t have it .
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise . &quot;
the united states of america is the only country in the world , dreizehnjährige children &apos;s death in prison .
in south africa , people have understood that it &apos;s not to overcome the rassentrennung and reconciliation .
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the evolution .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i started a new university called singularity university .
but then the technology of the elektrolyse was developed , and made aluminiumherstellung so cheap that we use it to use .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet with 5.000-mal more energy than we use every year .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the abundance , as no one would have ever predict .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard about .
imagine , if you have a blinddarmentzündung , and you get involved in a operateur , which is durchschnittsleistung 400 in terms of blinddarmentzündungen .
other medical professionals are also afraid , but the notfallmedizin is quite special because we just see the patients .
if i was in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
and this was an example , which is the way our own governments , the technology , against us .
the first betonblocksteine were made 1868 and entstammten of a simple idea : modules from cement with festgelegten measurements that fit .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
lego basically has the betonbaustein , the building block of the world , and it made a building block for our imagination .
as the betonblock , the transistor allows us to build much larger , more complex circuits , a pebble after the other .
instead of coding , you have to program , verdrahten or löten , allow you to program a simple intuitive gestures .
i grew up in the woods of britisch columbia , and i believed that these forests are going to be there .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to be able to do this area .
the answer is : you &apos;re looking at the doctor the next morning , and asking a change of the prescription .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
oppertunitätskosten reduces happiness that we get through our choices , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to do that .
so we think that this is a situation in the software , actually , building its hardware hardware in a biological system .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information is really accurate .
triplets this letter -- that these letters encode about 20 amino acids ; there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so people who think of evolution as a gene has changed a lot of the biology .
and it &apos;s just selection of selection . we can look for lebensfähigkeit , production of chemicals or treibstoffproduktion , and so on .
but to be fair -- the group of the chemist has not given the reputation of alkoholsüchtigen people .
from socrates , he &apos;s known that he believed he had a dämon , he had a dämon mitteilte .
in these opportunities , the poem came up and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
he just looked into the sky and said , &quot; excuse me , can you &apos;t see that i drive car ? “ ? &quot;
more importantly , are physically , so you know , you can just move them through the light of hands and access .
so , i think , from the biohackerszene , we &apos;re actually going to step further than the academic world .
he came up with this helmet this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum , that went .
now , we &apos;re thinking our love of stories depends on the lap of our parents .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce with the real world we produce with the real world .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing .
so a lot of natural , which is a backpack , but i think it &apos;s sort of salt , where is salt and pepper .
and at the end of the left , it &apos;s just intuitive , and hopefully i hope that no sugar is in there .
i &apos;ll get the whole full thing , now , and can now filter and say , show me all the thing about chocolate .
every day , they give you a scale of magnitude , about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to add two grams of phosphorus every day .
if i go to the dinner and say yes , there &apos;s a pill with offenbach-geschmack and a glass of water .
if you take those windel , you zerkleinern , sterile and the powder , to plant trees .
today , i want to share with you what else i &apos;m going to translate to , which is , again , translating into a verbal language .
today , a modern orchestra in the situation is able to play everything that a orchestra orchestra has refused to do at the time .
but this sort of doofes , like n solarpendel out of the square square of the square square , was a toy .
of course , you have to communicate on the battery , you have to be able to communicate into the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
we can start to integrate on the island of the island , and we can start integrieren , because they manage the burden .
so , a lot of people and looking at this is because you can see what problems you get .
he just heard a demo of beethoven first , and fourth symphony , and he came up with the stage to imagine me .
i said , &quot; miguel , do you fly 240 miles to the farm and fly over to 240 miles the night ?
okay . a farm that &apos;s not feeding your fish . a farm that measures your success on success .
and if it was fought by the system , and that leaves the water as it is hereingekommen .
you might say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about barsch or fleischrindern .
now what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in which food actually tastes well .
so you can see that this is looking at information and data in this way very much at swimming in a lifetime .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got two years later , when we moved to california .
i &apos;ve convinced you , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to the train . we &apos;re going to go to the train .
no one had ever explored the inside of the system . you didn &apos;t have a means for it . so we developed technology .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than anyone else on the planet .
in common , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we &apos;ll get a reduction in three or maybe a factor of six .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be all day , and it &apos;s not all the time .
this is what happens when you &apos;re trying to get these unterbrochenen sources about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the time .
so , to reach that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , are completely umstellen .
you should go to this innovationsstrategie and you would be shocked by the ridiculous little geldern that will be spent for these innovative approaches .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is , despite all of our achievements , a billion people are going to go hungry every day .
but now , if you have to get the evidence you have to accept this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .

so as quickly as fast as the transporttechnologie advances would be , then we could get übermorgen into a taxi and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
that was never before in history before , this kind of rekursivem growth of growth , through which the scale of all the years has increased exponentially .
in fact , the tröpfchen , which had one for the growth of growth composition , had faster than others and integrated more chemicals from outside the outside and faster .
my current activity is to design objects with such a vast complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design these in the traditional sense .
of course , the chance of randomly chosen instructions is very small that by chance , they &apos;re just set up numbers , so they probably don &apos;t do the instructions .
there is , &quot; this airplane is made of hunderttausenden kleinteilen , which work together to make their flight safe . &quot; don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came to me and she said , &quot; bryan , do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
one night , i stayed too long , and i thought , oh , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have zauberkräfte .
we bring our students all through these technologies with special focus on how they can be used to solve the big challenges of humanity .

it became exprimiert in the cell and realized the chromosome the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we had only one cell with a new chromosome .
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to create your whole life and never create a book again , anyone in the world ? never again ? “ ?
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen a performance in your life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pein when they didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of their existence came from them .
i think that the molecular in general now is speaking , well , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
so , of course , as crazy in the context of my speech , we may sound physically in not existenten , virtual worlds , to the model of the holodecks model .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are you going to start with all the class of your life with natural , archaischen urformen of communication , interactions and so on .
so , if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a little bit of reference , we &apos;re going to move to the fourth gesellschaftsgeneration or gesellschaftsform .
that is , in fact , the local village has become a global village with the same principles , of course , of course , but the total transparency .
that means that we &apos;re just seeing our vision before we see it back in our seheapparat , to say , okay , okay , okay , okay .
we only have for two years of phosphorus and already being brought in the world with a lot more uranium in the world &apos;s environment than in all atomanlagen .
if all the fingers in time and right , like it &apos;s in the notes , they &apos;re moving out , then they come out of sound that sounds like music .
only if you take another example , so if you &apos;re going to get the one a haystack higher , then you don &apos;t need a sense and nothing .
this is going to be a greenhouse gas system , which then , of course , hydrogen , methane , you know , power to gas , you know , it will be sch .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet , and also have a vision .
now , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat , what they would eat in the wild .
and we bogen around the corner , and we were offered to the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker , literally , a chimpanzee &apos;s teppich carpet so far the eye .
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that &apos;s not feeding their animals and a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators .
you see , we &apos;re doing the first time in the net as if it &apos;s really a web , not just to side , but much more abstract .
and my love to science fiction seemed to look at my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and exploring the deep sea .
we had to do this at the time . if we were children , we took the description of the autors , we had the description of the autors in our heads .
and something interesting happened , which is what i was fascinated with jacques cousteaus , which was the idea of a completely unknown world on our planet itself .
anyway , in the part of the part of a curiosity and science , it was all . it was an adventure , it was a curiosity . it was imagination .
because we did all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working for years , and sometimes we were two to three months a row on sea .
so , again , i came back with a little team on unbekanntem terrain , and we got &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology , &quot; which was not before .
so , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have to have a way to have energy in times if you &apos;re not available .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward .
and we start by taking the waste , which is already there , which is in these kühlbecken or trockenbehältern in these reactors . this is our startbrennstoff .
so that &apos;s what was a problem for these reactors , which , what we do in our fill and that will dramatically reduce the risk of this process .
bg : well we need one of these skalierbaren , stromgenerierenden things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then spend 20 years .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all about what it takes us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment to a moment .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country that they live on .
and i was amazed to get on resistance , on resistance to what is the most effective action in human history in human history .
now , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning , somebody has a plane in lagos , and she &apos;s going to los angeles right now , at the moment of los angeles .
and in a few hours , he goes and mietet a car , and he comes to long beach , and he will visit one of those fantastichen ted-dinner tonight .
if you go to this path , where you think and magic and magic , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid , and it &apos;s not enough to be the skin , just for a few minutes . &quot;
they didn &apos;t care because he was verblieben with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and memory was all he had to keep .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable , which is unlike a erinnerndes self , has a very little bit of influence on this story .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re doing a holiday , it &apos;s very often the case , which means we &apos;re doing a holiday in the service of the erinnernden self .
you can know how happy someone is with your life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much how happy he lives and vice versa .

if you play , you see some nuances here , which are gezogenen eyes up , and the mouth is a sign of optimism , the eyebrows surprise .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied why we &apos;re doing better in games than in real life .
we trust that somebody will spend time with us that the rules are going to be eingehalten , that we have the same goal , and until the end of it .
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the world yet .
and imagine i actually negotiate as a child &apos;s child with dr. p. , trying to stop this practice , natürllich without success .
they were just told that they were the einser-schüler and the students with the note , and so they &apos;ve taught them something and they treated .
and as we talk about bacteria , you know , that every one of us in our gut has more bacteria than cells in the rest of our bodies ?
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that &apos;s not natural , but led to us as a individuen. in decisions that we make .
play is a formwandler , and it can take a lot of shapes , which some of them are a little bit quiet , phantasievoll , curious -- perhaps to discover this .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us research , and we interact . and the unexpected verknüpfungen that we form are the real nährboden of creativity .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in the middle 1979 , at exactly the same day , in exactly the same moment , every zeugt baby -- okay .
what she was doing was a konzept concept , and they managed to do it through another that was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our intuitions refused to the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy in the bottom of a very basic concept of anatomy .

i love to have a different opportunity to find a different kind of crazy outfit , to wear , and also photograph in the last time .
now , this is just one example of how we can now feel the city in a way that we couldn &apos;t do a few years ago .
but for over two weeks , we have programmed , we went to strandpromenade in venice , my kids were involved , including my dog and we created this .
about three or four years ago , i received a call in the middle of the night , from this teacher , woman , who said , &quot; i have to see it .
now , if we can do it , the systems that control and valves control , then we can actually create a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
and i called them , and i found their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and the data .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotors , you &apos;re actually able to actually crack the rotor and eventually , to get rid of the centrifuge .
so the idea is , besides showing , that brands are part of the life , actually , to take the film ?
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that &apos;s got a negative konnotation -- but you know how this is going to evolve ?
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet , but i think it &apos;s definitely worth it , some really famous brands .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that these category really makes something positive , in contrast to &quot; fighting odor and humidity . &quot;
now , there are verspielte tags and achtsame brands , these things that come and go , but a verspielte , achtsame brand is a pretty strong thing .
that means that every atom at the same time is at two different places at the same time , which is the whole piece of metal in two different places .
but you could go to a completely new place , create a completely new road block , assuming the laws would be built one such way and not greater .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even children who are trying to find their parents to find their parents , in some cases , for a decade .
so what is it for an idea to insist on every family has a choice between multiple towns that are in competition around new residents ?
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read , and i ask you to clap , if you &apos;re ready , gary &apos;s offer .
i got a ticket because i &apos;m not on the radweg , but there are often disabilities that don &apos;t let you go to the radweg .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re also not making the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
i put it together with my former predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because when the camera was using the process , it was actually in planning .
we &apos;ve been told later that if it was about the normal canals , it took over two years and it cost over two million dollars .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals are organized , then we have a pretty good picture of how they do the anstellten .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
and it connects us all to something that is much greater , and it &apos;s also able to develop faster than we &apos;ve been in .
i know , and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because it comes from a series of hunderttausenden programs that have done the job .
we bring our kids together and closer to the natural world , and in the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
she took me outside and said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t get it . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who is older and a year older sister .
what it would feel like to live in a world where the german state of people ließ people in particular , especially if there were a lot of jews .
and then woman rejected in front of me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore you have to be very , very tapfer . &quot;
and every year we ask the students to create companies , products and services , which can influence life within a decade of people who can influence life .
and then their pupils expand , they &apos;re hit in front of their head , and then they look down , and they &apos;re schlucken to tell their stories .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in urban societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
we want the world creators , the inventor , the mitwirkenden , because that world we live in , these interactive world , we &apos;ve heard .
now there are some of us who are sort of forgotten that when i say &quot; different possibilities of his being , &quot; really different possibilities of his own .
this is a people who are not cognitively in between the colors and green , because the forest of the forest that people depend on .
this tribe , the cofan , 17 varieties of ayahuasca that you see all at large distance in the forest , which are kind of like a way .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one , for example , is a scan of the kongressbibliothek and it &apos;s in a field of 300 megapixeln .
and this is something that is through complexity , with the people that use it , growing and using it for the user .
if people have freedom , every one of us is going to do the things that we are trying to maximize and nobody has to decide for us .
and they will answer these questions regardless of whether that means to make all the tasks i &apos;m going to give you , and not a good note in my course .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of inerte chemical , and in a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
and i have argued that we might be able to create a new form of kambrischen explosion that could be massive new artenbildung based on this digital design .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we get beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
and what &apos;s going on with the creative project is that they &apos;re going to make us more insecure about the amount of engagement -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construction that will protect you from the consequences of your work .
it &apos;s kind of a very sad thing to do , because it &apos;s not exactly what it &apos;s actually done , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
another thing out of the united states that also has to do with this vaterschaftstestgeschichte is the p.c.r , which is the polymerase-kettenreaktion , complicated word .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap yet , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it is going to be clear .
and if you want to be able to make a professional citizen decisions in society , and if you want to be able to join , you need access to knowledge and to technology .
and that wealth that the virtual to virtualisieren the reality , the people who have needed the people in the vorindustriellen times , because they had nothing .
and as you can see , this is a very inselreiches area , and you had to sort of navigate , from island to iceland to get food .
that means that instead of remembering us , we have more sensitive , widespread , highly common patterns of memories that we can depend on for our personal memories .
very direct , and it wasn &apos;t for the company of puma , but for that company , they &apos;re now helping this company to make these products successfully .
it was on a klavierkursus for musikstudenten in my beloved old teacher , professor jürgen ude , a famous beethoven-spezialist , konzertpianist and long professor of musikhochschule here in stuttgart .
i &apos;ve told my wife , whenever a person in a moral fit , because used , should we try to replace it by replacing it even though .
so this verweis that , in the heart of the bub , knew that it &apos;s actually related to fire , but that he can &apos;t say that .
and if you have this premise in mind , you understand the logic that we &apos;re going to experience this happiness through a lie of our world .
it looks something like this who doesn &apos;t have any willensfreiheit , can &apos;t be pulled for his actions and claims , and therefore it &apos;s unzurechnungsfähig .
and yes , a lot of what &apos;s been said today , because many , many , many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve also lived through .
how big , because it would actually be a battery so that you could have an island to 20 , 30 , 40 , 40 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to turn off the igbo .
that our system also has a preisanstieg , because we &apos;re still going to do 20 percent of the diesel , and we don &apos;t have a preissteigerung on the other things .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years .
we came to music , and a few days later , i got an email in which said that nathaniel was interested in geigenunterricht for me .
now , after i &apos;ve chosen government &apos; government , i know that the wikipediakategorien , that the most people who are doing most of the time are &quot; people of the year . &quot;
so this is important , because you just look through the web of websites in this way , and you can look at the whole way of looking at the same way .
but the messlatte put it back pretty much back , and people in my company said that we haven &apos;t been able to do that .
and she made me consciously understood that you could use such a roboterhafte and sort of like your consciousness in the vehicle , into these other forms of existence .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m certainly thinking , a director needs to be able to be a leader like a schiffskapitän or something .
now , the exact relationship between a co2-anstieg and the dadurch and where the other consequences are , there are some of the themes , but not very much .
the terrapower-konzept means that instead of a part of the urans , one percent that u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
we should use the effektivitätsmaßnahmen to raise reduction in the way . the less we are emittieren , the less it will be , and the temperature is the temperature .
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can get it for 60 years -- think of a column -- they &apos;re buried without the whole complexities .
bill , i think , for almost all humans here , if i say , i really hope that your wish is going to be true . thank you very much .
the average for most is about 50cm , bwl-studenten , which is about half of them , but not much , kindergartenkinder are better than adults .
drinking water , urbares land , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re disappearing , and soon , and if we don &apos;t get away from this chaos , we also get away from that chaos .
now , what i hear all the time is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monokultur , we don &apos;t want a huge area with one thing that is wrong .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s the highest time to understand what that means .
how to increase happiness is very different from how they think and whether they think about the erinnernde self , or whether they think about it itself .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show you that we like to people , after playing with them , even when they &apos;ve been übel .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the werken of ancient greek historikers , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
so we &apos;re not only responsible for keeping people that we love to maintain , but they also prepare to get good at it .
you &apos;ve got to separate two things : to be the medical fact , to be the case , and for the other people who think i &apos;m disabled or not .
but they also true a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to increasing challenges , through greater creativity and druch cooperation .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexuelle are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some ways , you can spread over the entire bandwidth , you can be spread .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and acting in the world .
and since she &apos;s not heard of me when the woman , who &apos;s running around here at ted in her underwear -- is that i found a few things .
we found one for them , we took them , and we took care of them , and we gave her eight , eight , because it was necessary for it to be necessary .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the windows- part of the windows- part , the dropper- part of it made of unzähligen day- .
and if you &apos;ve seen that the dropper of stuxnet complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the nutzdaten are a science for itself .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing like this -- spaßig at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
what i want to do is to have a film about product placement , marketing and advertising , the whole film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
and this is not bad for a project where almost every werbeagentur , with which we talked to , their customers , the fingers of it .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms from those of you who are made of metal are still there and moving the same atoms at the same time .
so if a single atom can be at two different places at two different places , this piece of metal can be two different places , why not you ?
i loved it to this business ; but at one point i &apos;ve asked myself , well , how come you &apos;re never going to do anything ?
it also enables me to be more excited about the big product that i &apos;m looking at , and so i &apos;m willing to be motivated to be with interest with this .
it &apos;s not particularly scientifically scientifically science -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how ?
and you could have them connect them with government services , if they were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to state services .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like several others that we often find in our field , are a kind of semi-logarithmischen curve .
telefonie , computers , videobänder , cd-roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve built in our community to handle this information .
then she said , &quot; next to me , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing .
it became very quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever kill ourselves for the systematic killing of people .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the krankheitslast and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online to master the new challenges , and to do what is necessary .
and when i was able to get her chest chest , i could hear a knackendes sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering under kongestiver heart failure .
and then on a bewölkten day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke up and i could feel better again .
and i went back through the same tortur of shame and self-doubt , felt befreit , and i went back to work until it and again and again .
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your own mistakes .
then i take the same patient with brustschmerz , make it verschwitzt , and i &apos;ll give you a little bit of a breath and a little bit of a alkoholisierten breath , and suddenly the story is durchsetzt with contempt .
the u.s. intelligence agency fror two months ago the swiss account of mr. sam jain here here , and on this proposition were 14,9 million dollars as it was frozen .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of your extraordinary discoveries . like this plant here .
they didn &apos;t listen to the sioux , as they were aufgaben and pfeil tasks , when americans stopped being americans when they stopped horse and pferdewagen tasks .
and even though you &apos;re all off , every minute we &apos;re going to ask our child &apos;s salary , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i accept this call ?
the reason that i felt worse was to feel worse with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans , went up .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
we find all sorts of species here recorded the second chromosome , or a third of irgendwoher , every thousands of characteristics in only one second to a species .
they &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we &apos;re always a year at the back and we have a dollar , if it comes to the right vaccine .
we &apos;re going to turn it around , and we &apos;ll expect to be able to collect data in june or july , and put our journey on to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , on a kind of spark of accidents like this , again , the debate of science and ingenieurskunst of science . it &apos;s easy , so it &apos;s easy to reject .
because it makes a lot of sense just as much as anything that i &apos;ve heard about , if it was about explaining the absolute crazy launenhaftigkeit of the creative process .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me that he was going to go to los angeles one day , and he changed everything for him .
in this case , we have three siftables as farbtöpfe konfiguriert and i can use them to cast color in the middle , where they will mix up .
you pour d.n.a on goldpartikel , and then you put them in these luftdruckpistole , and then i &apos;ve shot it on stimulus , and then put the lights on it .
and we hope , of course , that we will continue to expand , and then also , as well as well , are linked to , as well as well , so that we can get more people involved .
the second aspect is that since this archaischen models , we &apos;ve been able to talk very , very , very compelling , even though we &apos;re using a kodifizierte language .
but for me , in the realm of interactive media as a particularly impressive thing , that we &apos;ve evolved in our biological memory , the ability to think of the ability to think .
so you &apos;ve got to engage in terms of what is that , and not just change it , it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this one , yes , is not actually , but here in this rosanen mass just starting to happen .
usability is always , like , i can do a certain goal , or how can a user be able to achieve a certain nutzungskontext , efficient , efficient thing .
and because they &apos;re working much harder than we are and because they live only three to six months , they are in their weight , in the energy , something 30 billion people .
and then there &apos;s also abstufungen , whether you learn it for the hausgebrauch , just passive understanding or you can also talk to the musical speaker .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to make it happen over another way , so over a tool , to sound sound .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first sentence of this is wrong , as if you have to think of the opposite without evidence .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of map the electric trajectory of the island at the scale of the island .
so there &apos;s always going to be a discussion that &apos;s going to try and do these things that are autark , which are autark , which has nothing to do with our verbund .
okay ? there we were , and we fought by the wetlands and i keuche and schwitze , matsch to my knees , and miguel is staying in silence .
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fischhaut . i don &apos;t like sautiert . i don &apos;t like it .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of wonder were that we could never have imagined before .
i nervte my father , until finally finally , a tauchschule in buffalo , new york , discovering exactly the other side of the border where we lived .
and it worked . again , we created something magic , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we have a little bit more money on the movie .
so i started a company , with my good friend stan winston , who was at the time of the best make-up- and creature-designer . she was called &quot; digital domain . &quot;
you go up into these capsule , you go down into this dark , feindselige environment , where no hope is to rescue if you don &apos;t get it back .
and i wonder what they would choose because i &apos;ve been asking my friends for the last time , and they all wanted to go to the past .
this is the greatest time that ever existed on this planet , no matter what scale you put in : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining krankheitsraten .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .

so i came up with the need just a check out , and instead , i put a check out of that i didn &apos;t have the slightest idea of how i was going .
so , that really began my interest and we started working on it , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
and i began to work with scientific literature , like these zentrifugen in natanz , and found that they &apos;re strukturiert in what &apos;s called kaskaden , and every calorie contains 164 zentrifugen .
i have a check in my pocket , ausgestellt on the oberorganisation of the ted-organisation , the sapling-stiftung -- a check at a height of dollars to fund my ted-auftritt in the next year .
but i bet that he taught a very valuable lesson with a very valuable lesson , which is that the big things don &apos;t just leave you , and that you stay at a point .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of fondsangebote that was possible to be able to do a rentensparplan plan , the 401 plan , would change whether more for tomorrow .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different kinds of forschungsorten -- that they can just apply to their business .
and it turns out that if you make it feel that something feels specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to make people save more .
because , of course , she &apos;s not something you can actually catch , but i always want to let it look like you could have that , on a photograph .
so every morning i jumped into my wlan-waage and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; lunch just a little lettuce today , lucien . &quot;
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , send it to their physician and share it for example , to share something more than 100 dollars .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. department of town , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but for the citizens to adopt tsunami-sirenen .
and because the government finally takes their strength out of us -- erinner yourself : &quot; we are the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to affect how this change happens .
but then another , very interesting step happened , where things were completely different , and that cells began to communicate and exchange information , so communities were made of cells .
so these communities began to become weiterzuentwickeln , so that the level , on which evolution was not the single cell , but the whole zellengemeinschaft , which we call organism .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and took this sixpack beer with his sister and me and walked into the forest .
now , with all our digital devices , which we have seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
consider that a large fraction of americans who live under the poverty line are access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv , cell phones , mobile phones .
if i think of creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of opportunities .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , which i feel much more comfortable or maybe a little bit more comfortable than i &apos;ve talked to you about .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was so able to get my patients to do without having to contact it .
if you think about &quot; avatar &quot; when you think about why people were so touched by this -- besides the pocahontas-geschichte , why were they touched by the bilderwelt ?
so i want to take you in a way to take a journey through the ethnosphäre , a short journey through the ethnosphäre , to try to understand what &apos;s actually lost .
offspring of the old tyrannischen civilization that küstenebene the caribbean &apos;s heart institute , and follow in the aftermath of the civil war , and follow that these people in a isoliertes vulkanisches massive way back across the karibischen .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and now we try to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new life and building .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward this chromosome , actually , to actually minimize the single components of what allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who would really berechtigte scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- feen , people nachfolgen and feenzauber on their projects , etc .
if you may just believe that you &apos;re a loaner -- from a unvorstellbaren source for a long time of your life , which is passed to someone else when you &apos;re done with it .
as they realized how to reach their hands , and they would take the klötze and move it , they actually learned , they actually learned to try and solve and change the context of the context .
and it &apos;s just been done with software , but it &apos;s also in the elektronikbereich , because there &apos;s also a whole bastlerszene that can do all sorts of abgefahrenen things .
and it &apos;s like , &quot; well , this is a sort of a hirnwellenmessgerät , &quot; so e.e.g or something , so he &apos;s focused on neurobiologie , his nickname is sam .
because , in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a little bit of a sense of it , and also not a chance to make it really good .
that means alarm , if you know that now , pay attention to who you &apos;re looking for , because i &apos;m not übernehme , because i &apos;m not doing a gewähr for what &apos;s going on .
that doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re likely to go home probably four hours , but your employers , or somebody , you can see it , as it goes with the four hours .
and if you give people the people who do it , if you say it would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re going to be raffgierig and hostile .
at this point , when you laugh , you see how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience something that artists can tell very well .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , that courage for lying .
i &apos;m grateful to the premium-kola-mensch that he &apos;s having the word again , because after the mauerfall , you couldn &apos;t use the word , because everything left was bad .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for the outside of the sea , that your environment is not verschmutzt . &quot;
some people say , you know , you don &apos;t have to work at the insurance , because you might be lazy , so you &apos;re going to eat , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the herzoperation .
but because that &apos;s not what &apos;s happened here , we can put it in denial , and people like jenny can walk around and send messages from fear and the larry and the larry king of plattformen .
but i think in this frame here , and with the purpose of a deception , i &apos;m going to make a little bit of the needle just there , and so on the stage .
from the point of view of self , if you have a vacation and the second week is exactly as good as the first , then the zweiwöchige holiday is twice as good as the einwöchige holiday .
if people would take this befund seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on your head , everything we believe in terms of steuerpolitik and so on .
so here we have a complete parallelbildungsweg , on the young people learning what it means to be a good player , how everything else you learn in school .
this was dr. kean , a man i knew only from narratives of my mother , because i was , of course , in my birthday two weeks too late .
and most of all , are we ever going to be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to make , to make these decisions ?
we &apos;re often talking about the very young people with spinal cord that &apos;s in the height of their lives -- twenty , 30s , &apos; 40s , and the wheelchair is the only option .
i want to argue that i probably know some of the light patterns that are fähiger , more intelligent , more intelligent and more unequal decisions to make your sexual relationships than some 40-jährige that i know .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go to the future , if we have democracy on anatomy -- to think less about the individual bodies of what identity affects , and more about relationships .
and finally , saturday : one , unique , personal style to develop is a great way to tell the world something about a word without having to say a word .
it started with a question of bürgermeisters , which came to us and said that spain and südeuropa have a beautiful tradition , in public places as part of the architecture .
and one of the ideas that have been done at mit , in a arbeitskreis , was , you know , these schläuche , and valves , magnetventile , things that open and close .
but then it could only be a 3d cloud of bildpunkten that they can go to , and through that they can move through a lot of , many directions .
now , for the first time , for the first time -- and the council of obama has shown this -- we can move from the digital world , from the selbstorganisierenden forces of the networks to the physical world .
but tomorrow , it can , to give us the challenges to the challenges -- think about climate change , or co2 emissions -- how can we turn from digital world to the physical world .
i just want to talk to him again and i said , &quot; wait a minute , is this not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all communicate with this thing ? &quot;
but if we can do it that a effective windows-virus on a laptop is used by a wartungsingenieur , it &apos;s the gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at a tedtalk in a tedtalk the world of branding and sponsoring , i knew i would do something slightly different .
18 months ago , i was doing something different about google , and i &apos;m going to do something with museums and art , and my chefin , which is the same thing that we have today .
i mean , it can be strange to think that a thing is at two different places at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed them .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in the elevator are actually quanten objects that are in a small space together .
we have six different tastes there , or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things , first of all , i think , what would be more people going to stay and try to do marmelade ?
i had to make sure it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the history was trying to zerdrücken us , but we did it .
every dollar has been given , and it was made in other education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do for it . mostly the new stuff that came out of the second hand .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to get them to play any kind of game to control their health better .
so they have either survived , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeated more often and threatened by evolution .
it &apos;s this kopf-herz-verbindung that i think is driving us , not only to be open for all the bright and begeisternden things , but also for the dark and problematischen .
there are no dimensions of technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears , ausgrenzung and injustice .
so these are just some of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days . or the last six years .
they use tools like the staatstrojaner to bespielen their computer with a trojaner , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their online-diskussionen , their passwörter , their passwörter .
here &apos;s a picture i took at the northern end of the baffin-inseln when i went to the narwhal-jagd , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant goals of earth , to realize that they &apos;re not at all .
they represent parts of the human imagination , in the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , the dreams of hope of hope .
and of course , byproduct of all this is the immense rich virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that are not only through überflüge or satellitenbilder and so on , but through collective memory .
and then you go to the verbraucher-elektronik business for a stereo -- speaker , cd-player , cd-player , a kassetten-player , radio , 365 , and in this one electronics , there are so many stereo facilities .
work -- we are blessed , as carl demonstrated , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every day on the planet -- until the randolph hotel .
it &apos;s a picture of the first strahlenpartikels that the entire round around the lhc , then intent with a part of the lhc , kollidierte a rain of particles on the detector .
and it &apos;s very , very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now , from the world as the work of the work , came out of my last book , right ?
because -- -- at the end of the end is how it follows , centuries ago , in the deserts of nordafrikas people to mondscheinfesten people with holy tänzen and music that were stopped for hours -- until dawn .
an interesting episode of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data like color , like color , how to do this with liquids .
i graduated in the degree , and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , that &apos;s the bachelorarbeit of michael burk , ann-kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan-moritz müller .
but there are also symbolic functions , why is there a little bit of a täschchen , sort of , where you don &apos;t know anything , or anything like that , so horrende summen of money , even though it &apos;s not so much ?
when we go back into the field of software , here &apos;s the first command line , which was very abstract , where you took months to deal with these systems .
not to burn a little bit better , a little bit better , and to lose it and to lose all the materials for the cycles of cycles , but to ask , how do you make cycles ?
but over time , as a creator , you know , you have a rich knowledge for the composers you play more and more and more easily , and it &apos;s easier to feel in it .
i have become older , and the seasons go down , my pulse goes slower when the morning , in a konzertsaal , it takes longer than the sound back home .
after the logic that these deception , this self-deception , the willingness , a different reality , as we actually know in the world , is that they &apos;re supposed to be valid .
the beauty is that you &apos;re in this island , basically , in this island , where you &apos;re going to be able to get the problems that we &apos;re going to get , if we want to increase our species of renewables .
i have to mention that nathaniel is a medical treatment , because he had been treated with electricity and with thorazin and handcuffed , a trauma that he had all his life .
and in the same way that we had a reizstadium , nathaniel , when we first started with our first study in walt disney hall , he had lost this amazing flackern in his eyes and he was completely lost .
and like a miracle , he took his violin and started playing a few clips from violinkonzerten , and then asked me to the end , and then she asked me to finish , mendelssohn , tschaikowski , sibelius .
once the first thing is done , when it &apos;s going like this , it &apos;s all clear , it &apos;s all clear , because the wirtschaftlichkeit , the energy density is so different as we know it .
because it is , you &apos;re very short in front of a kostendurchbruch and funded only the learning curve , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much less expensive .
it requires that we all have our senses to the task , and we think we use our optimal , like our emotions and our do , in the challenge that lies in front of us .
but if you give the shape that you give back to placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and that blue color , and that blue color , it &apos;s actually measurable .
so i propose , if you &apos;re going to get fast , you &apos;ll look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first heiklen part here .
it &apos;s true for laien , which is thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just like anyone else .
imagine your next holiday , you know , at the end of the urlaubs , all of your images are being wiped out , and you get a amnestisches drug , so you will remember nothing .
anyone who &apos;s not going to distinguish these terms of happiness is the study of happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers who have adapted to the study of happiness for the very long time that kind of thing .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , in climate .
and they would be so eager to be in the würfelspiel , because games are so fascinating and with befriedigender productivity , glückseliger productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use in the real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
and to be honest , the only real and sustained disability that i had to go apart is that the world is constantly calling me with these definitions .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all his forces and possibilities and appreciate and recognize , in addition to the natural fight you might have to have another disease .
and perhaps this change could happen , because i &apos;ve met so many people who have opened doors to me , rather than people who refused to join me or to me .
from a evolutionary standpoint , they are and i like booster rockets to send the genetic fracht into the next stage of the orbit , then to drop into the ocean .
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can allow the change that changes to prevent disease could also enable us to adopt the disease , verabschieden -- the better memory .
they &apos;re not something that they put in the morning , and they give them extra strength and will increase their velocity , and they will help them , for example , balance .
so if i look in this room and see people who have either had a beachtenswerten success , or on their way , i want to offer this memory : don &apos;t wait .
it &apos;s meant to be able to give , in average , , in average , the female brains of male brains differ of what makes us aufmerksamer for social relationships , and to care for the schutzbedürftige .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we design .
and the coolste is -- and this is the whole circle -- that this april , this april , in the middle of los angeles , there will be an exhibition called &quot; style of the streets . &quot;
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had anything to do with augenerfassungstechnologie , but i just captured something , and with amazing people with amazing people so we could put something on the legs .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
and if you &apos;re playing with your particles , you can see all kinds of weird things -- like you &apos;re flying through walls , or that you can be at the same time at two different places .
so i was asked by the president of honduras , who said that we need to make this project happen , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to bring our country forward .
in fact , the first time you have to look at more information in the first time , more information than the second time , but i would be able to guess it by the second time .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us behave like knotenpunkte , to behave in the world around the world .
but more importantly , that app is that it represents a new generation that the problem of government -- not as the problem of a verknöcherten institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the mitdem internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things in common , you have to build the only systems .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically putting grunzende sounds from me in hope to create a similar entertaining idea in your mind , which has a certain kind of similarity with my original idea .
i live a living from building computers , and i know that i &apos;m going to use the mechanism that i use to build computers , not use , not using the very recently progress in computing .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to put us the big challenges of our planet .
and at the end of the day i grabbed my things , down the hospital , and i went to the car section to drive the car , when i did something i didn &apos;t do .
and there &apos;s another nurse , not the sister &apos;s sister &apos;s sister &apos;s printer , but another three words to me and those three words that i know , most of the notfallärzte i know .
and in fact , if i knew or knew my colleagues that a orthopäde in my hospital would have lost someone &apos;s wrong leg , they believe i would have trouble looking at it .
a couple of weeks ago , we were brought to risd , and we gave them a few designers who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said to them , &quot; power . &quot;
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything , and they found that these business books were the visitenkarten of the devil .
you know , we really -- moderate goals like the ersatz of the entire petrochemischen industry . right . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else you can &apos;t do it in ted .
my father , for example , was chemist and i can &apos;t be at any point in his 40 years as a chemist in which he asked to be afraid to be a chemist .
it was as if the time stillstehen and the dancers go through a kind of pforte , and he didn &apos;t do anything different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before . but everything was added together .
if an performer in spain has done something magical , something magic has done : „ allah , olé , olé , allah , great , bravo , bravo “ , because it &apos;s a flüchtiger view of god .
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic eiskappe , which had the size of the unteren , the size of the lower 48 states in order to 40 percent .
and when these tools become physical and develop a conscious awareness for their movements , each other can detect each other and perceive the subtleties of our umgangs , then we can begin to start exploring new and entertaining interaktionsarten .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do the whole thing on german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equivalent to translation of translation of translation .
now , there &apos;s a lot of the notes in the anliegens of congress &apos;s record , but just a framework , so i &apos;m going to turn this framework to make it happen with sense and meaning .
it &apos;s not too late to start to find out whether you can &apos;t even do it , or learn how to get these little muscles that put the vocal chords right .
and this is what we &apos;re doing , and in the process , the talk of premium kola is that you can be a collective , and you can use solar energy , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and i realized that when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a unreinheiten , he &apos;s enormous , because the water , which flows through this farm comes from the river .
businesses that are not the worlds for themselves , businesses that are acting rather than aufzubrauchen , businesses that are growing , instead of just having intense , farmers who are not just making , but experts for relationships .
pivot , these exercise -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we bring these zoom-technologie to every single website like this .
we then created a reality , in fact , six months later , in which i &apos;m in a russian tauchboot , four kilometers under the surface of the north atlantic , and i &apos;m looking at the real titanic through a bullauge .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the fensters .
klimaverschlechterung means that their saaten is not going to grow over many years ; it &apos;s too much rain or too rain . things are going to change the way they can &apos;t withstand the environment .
the kohlerevolution ran the industrial revolution and even in the 20th century , there was a fast case in the elektrizitätspreis and therefore , and therefore we have refrigerators , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
so to understand that , that means to build deep in the ground almost like a vertical column of nuclear brennstoffs , that uses urans and then the process starts to go down ?
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built this , which is why everyone has a fast reactor , a kandidatat for our first .
and finally , soon before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and you put it carefully on top of the top , step back and said , &quot; do you admire your work . &quot;
but then , almost always , almost always happens , that the &quot; ta-da &quot; becomes a &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because of the weight of the marshmallows , the whole thing is verbiegt and einstürzt .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we &apos;re seeing , what we think we &apos;re going to see , that we &apos;re really feeling .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the nachdenkliche self , deciding how happy people are .
so , the problem of the world of warcraft like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying at any time at the edge of a epischen , that we &apos;re going to spend our whole time in these spielwelten .
first of all , for children in the united states , 10.080 hours are the precise gesamtzeit that they spend in school , from the fifth grade to the degree of high school -- if you never miss .
we &apos;re putting games in order to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that doesn &apos;t tolerate the real life , and we take what we need from games .
i know you &apos;re going to ask questions , &quot; how do we solve the real world in games ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve been doing in the last few years on the institute for the future .
the other volunteers who arrived in front of me -- let &apos;s call him lex luther -- reached the hauptmann as first and was asked to go to the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
years ago , when i went to graduate school , one of my favorites asked me that my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , so do it -- a really strange question .
no longer a building that would open up to leave you , but a building that had still collapsed and holes in the water , you had to jump out now without getting wet .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept of advertising was to present your product as many people as possible , as many people as you can see .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; you have been welcome to me , &quot; why my good friends report of emc , who paid $ 7100 for the namensrechte of ebay . &quot;
otherwise , i &apos;m going to ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , well , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem ?
i &apos;m not going to be very interested in this , when i was a friend told me , i should look at this great video , about a guy who protestiert in new york versus bicycles .
you see , who we were , and how life has shaped us , we can see that the men who might have come to our lives in our lives would have come to us into the quere .
now we have &quot; drei-verstöße , &quot; -gesetze , the people who get out of bars forever , for a fahrraddiebstahl , for the theft of the moral geringfügigen , rather than that you force the sacrifice .
this is a state in which the heart of the heart fails , rather than the entire blood , put it up , and it &apos;s a part of the blutes in the lung , and it &apos;s going to be füllt .
so , in fact , it really failed to me that i asked the nurse , which was a nurse &apos;s printer , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s okay if you go home ? &quot;
so you could think that the problem of people who were , surely , when they lived in räuberischen societies , were killing animals and only a few generations of what they had done .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious answer is people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter , because i &apos;m a second-class citizen .
they threw some seals from the air down , which we would expect as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest are never seen anything zweidimensionales .
now , the fascinating thing is that the betakarboline , which are in the liane , are mao-inhibitoren from exactly the kind of thing that is necessary to potenzieren the tryptamine . so ask yourself .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that the power of a system like this einschränken is the number of pixeln on your screen is in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
do i understand you right ? your software allows you to be in a particular period of time , within the next few years , all the images that are being used by someone in the world is basically interconnected ?
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternative to mind , it &apos;s just attractive qualities of alternative , which makes them worthwhile , that makes them less comfortable with the alternatives that they &apos;ve chosen .
but , the knifflige part , the next morning , when the dancer wakes up himself and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a fünkchen of god .
if in an environment , where the adults are actively practicing music or at least active music , a child grew up , then it &apos;s very easy for a musiklehrer , to ask what color color ?
and then i went to sechsundneunzig ausgehalten and then we have become the mitbegründer of the company , which then became solon with the spin-off q-cells of one of the largest zellenhersteller of the world .
and what we &apos;ve done since zweitausendneun has been the city of the city , until today , almost all of the things that we &apos;ve done in the single system , in software , was to develop software , we did .
you can go through the n , you can get the nets , yes , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do on any case , the proportion , but you can never get on memory .
bg : when you get to this situation , it &apos;s like eating too much , and a heart of a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a herzoperation or something .
you get too big geldsummen , and you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and try to fund it . for me , most of the waste .
what &apos;s going to do differently is they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so that they have mehrfach the ability to fix the baufällige prototypes .

and there &apos;s only one of these little devices up there , because things are supposed to be more intuitive , always more intuitive , more natural , and you &apos;ve got to see what &apos;s actually going on for us humans , of course , or intuitively .
this was a riesen-aufschrei , of course , because of course the living language began in the form of writing in the form of writing , which is what fluid and alive is , let me go and do it in stone , and i do it .

i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been studying a couple of years ago , and this is what i started , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do it , and i wanted to do it in the study of theoretical theory .
there are also things that have come out of everyday life , which most people are not aware of , for example , waschmittelenzyme , which allow us to wash with 40 degrees of laundry , are also gentechnisch optimierte enzymes .
because i believe that the interactive media media in us , cognitive models , are adressieren , so paradigm that has been in our biological memory , very long time , and that we &apos;re able to do that just through interactive media .
and so i get from the city a very different view of a very different impression , which is , i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get this kind of virtual , virtual map of a very real city .

if we change the plastics , so he can go in biological systems , if we change the wasserspeicher , that you can just go back to zellulosebasis , then you can plant the trees in israel or in tunisia in tunisia .

in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to do abstriche and less use , but in average , this number will grow up every year and so on , and so much more than double the number of services per person .
if we are in a spielwelt , i believe that many of us are going to transform our best version , anytime and immediately , persistent the problem , trying to solve the problem , as long as necessary , for the sake of time .

now , what this thing is , is that it &apos;s the default values of sensors -- so , for example , of drucksensoren and vibrationssensoren -- and it &apos;s legitimen code , and it &apos;s called the code code that &apos;s going on , with false forces .

it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was going over 20 years ago when i was a teenager for the first time , that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of angstbesetzter reaction .
i &apos;m a creator from house , so i &apos;m also interested in the subject of curiosity and how the curiosity is changing our thinking , and why we might lose curiosity , and why are we going to have to anstoßen , and so on .

he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never would be like other kids , like other kids , or that you could never have an independent life , and i &apos;ve just been lying to lie . &quot;

we took a ps3-kamera , they have auseinandergebaut , they set up on a led-licht , and now we have a device that is freely available -- you can build it yourself , we make the code free .
as i said , i &apos;ve been moving in some pretty awful situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could help me , something so hard and so dangerous with these guys in a room .
i also think there are theories that begin to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a little bit of a story about which , at that time , little öltröpfchen herumschwebten , which is different types of chemicals .
and it gets better , the things that you and i have spent a couple of dollars spent -- gps , hd-video and photograph , libraries of books and music , technology -- are now becoming entmaterialisiert and cheaper in your cell phone .

we believe that polemik -- we believe that polemik is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and are probably the best institution of storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million hits every month .

and this sounds and this rhythm , the geology , represented the topography of a region , and of course , that allows you to get these songs of the songs and assemble it to the left , to the left , to the left , and also move back to the left , to the right .
then the next , the next thing that we &apos;ve been talking about with &quot; three-year-old neural model , or mental model , &quot; would have been working on the software , which is , you know , you have an idea of something that &apos;s the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
and if i take a step further into these natural user interfaces , where i am by voice , by language , by language , by language , by law , and not more by mouse and cursor , things have to be more quickly and left .
so if you have that idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , you &apos;re going to be determiniert , from the larger amount that you have immediately , then you have quickly the feeling that there must be something like a free will .

if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish , which is halbierter energiepreis without co2 .

and it turns out that under income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under one income of 600,000 dollars a year in a year .
so perhaps this technological change is something obvious because ever that there &apos;s always been a different truth , which is that every human society is something that is a very powerful and very powerful human ability to adapt to adapt to our biggest plus .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : most of the lives of life in einzelligen organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going on into both tochterzellen .
i think they were so tapfer and strong , and so radical , in which what they were doing , i &apos;m going to look at the schmalzige musical 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
heinrich , because you assume it &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the xy -- because you assume it &apos;s male , it can be moved to what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science makes progress in the area of anatomy that we have to make a point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s based on anatomy could be auseinanderfallen ?
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i spoke to a few years ago , who had some siamesische twins with hergebracht to separate them , partly to make a name .

and finally , i believe that , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so inspiring , we &apos;re not going to be at the end of our technology , not the things we &apos;re developing , not in our intellect and mind .
about an hour after you got home , after i had sent them home , it collapsed and the family called 911 . the rettungsassistenten brought them back to the notfallstation with a blood pressure with a blood pressure .
but if you buy a new farblaserdrucker in 2011 in the world of 2011 , and a page , this page has bright yellow flecke on every page , in a pattern that makes the site clear to you and your printer .
understand that this is not just what people eat out of food when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to be able to get the decisions that they &apos;re missing great amounts of their employers .
so this is an effect . the other effect is that even if we get rid of paralysis and make a decision , we end less with the outcome of choice , when we had the opportunity to decide to decide between less choices .
but , as we think , the only way to make biology a huge impact without the cost of the cost of food , or the limitation of their availability is when we see co2 , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that are going to go that way .
and the truth with this premise with this premise then has tried to try and do brian degger in england , a minimallabor zusammenzustellen , and then took a dampfdruckkochtopf , a heizplatte and , yes , so suppenbrühe and bakterien bacteria .

and yes , so , you see , it &apos;s relatively relative , so there are people who do that in their home , so far larger organizations , so far larger organizations that don &apos;t do that already in institutionalisierter forms .
so , if i do this now , the profiler of the scene , then go to the scene , collect any haarproben , and then do this kind of thing , and then they can tell this kind of thing , and then they can tell you , you know , this is a man , and then you can tell .

he spoke in a very heiteren and geselligen sound about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and the dodgers of the dodgers would never be able to put it into baseball world , and that &apos;s all because of the tückischen passage of the first violin in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
and this curiosity also showed that i was not in school , when i was not in school , walked through the forests , and &quot; dig &quot; samples , frogs and snakes and bugs and bugs and teichwasser .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they thought that molecules were in a particular kind of detail that was a random kind of übergriff in nature .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we fear it is a real dead , and it holds millions of people from the demise .
if i would take this point seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would perceive as one person , whose life in any way that could be positive in any way . today , i &apos;m going to be entitled to the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
i may be more interested in asking you to realize that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome it , but we &apos;re open to them , to hug them , to put them on the schopf , and maybe even dance with it .

well , the problem- problem is that even those of us who have the kind of sympathy for the difficult condition , they look at the schwierige and farbenfroh , but they kind of look at the past , as the real world , which means our world , fortschreitet .

and if i keep a halboval dazusetze , we don &apos;t even see a unit yet , which is the circle , circle , and yet we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a different sequence , a different sequence .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to another , we can start to go from many things to a lot of things , and see patterns that otherwise would be hidden ?
so there &apos;s big preisherausforderungen . there are challenges in the transmission , and for example , if we say that the energy is in the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they have to do it with the risk of where it comes from .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t have a line for us , that nature and female and female and female and female and female and women are , tastächlich .
so , we started with some volunteers that we &apos;ve done something more than a year ago in seattle , which is to tag things that they &apos;re looking at -- different kinds of things you can see -- things that you would throw away from .
the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re going to take people back to do something , to do something and change the environment -- almost like we call it , wolkenbewegung , how we call it a scheunentor , but with a cloud .
this made me a different person as my friends under the kwakiutl who believe that these forests of the aufenthaltsort of hukuk and the gebogenen geister and the kannibalischen spirits are going to be in the world of the world , ghosts that they would participate in their hamatsa-initiation .

because we have this self-deception , this sense , great to be the highest of the highest creatures , not from one such kind of such as an organism , from something like an organism that still exists to us .
and later on this day , i was driving around this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
so not only a farm that &apos;s not feeding their animals , not just a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators , but a farm that is literally a wasser-aufbereitungsanlage , and not just for those fish , but for you .
this was the surrealste form of a déjà-vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i run around a corner , i still knew what was going on in the lichtkegel of the vehicle , because i went to the film for months of the film .

and dr. kean kept telling us , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , when they &apos;re not always said something else , and even if they get a little bit of support , they can achieve a lot of things . &quot;

and there was a time in which there was only jeans of some kind , and they bought them , and they were bad gepasst , they were incredibly unkomfortabel , and if they beat them enough enough , they started , &quot; ok &quot; anzufühlen .

and before the background , i was in the field of natural user interface , so the next generation in the human computer in the relationship with the human computer in the relationship of the human computer in the way that our tools , or how the computer is changing from the computer to the digital assistant .
and you can see that you have a our seven senses that most of us think we have only five , now , in fact , are just seven , and it &apos;s certainly going to be the next , eighth sense , and as an extension of our own selves .
i &apos;m probably , you know , the two nice girls , i guess , i &apos;m probably in the generation of this bad öko image , because i &apos;ve started studying commercial engineering , technical university , today , i think , i believe , kit .
well , what you could do with your patient , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , you could actually do the darmspiegelung of the patient &apos;s tube without too much to shake it .
i read this list of a friend of friend , and i had to laugh , it seemed so ridiculous , but i just came up until &quot; zugerichtet &quot; and couldn &apos;t be more weitersprechen , and i had to go to reading the emotional shock , and the verbundenden emotional shock .
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it &apos;s meant that he ended with the hammer , and he threw him on moses -- actually , you know , can still see a little bit untendrunter -- and he said , &quot; perché non parli ? &quot;
they knew that every year , they were leaving their land in the united states , and they wanted to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same in honduras .
it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really searches is someone who &apos;s freischaufelt him when he &apos;s eingeschneit , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at brandbekämpfung when he &apos;s zugedeckt from a meter .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking machines are , is we think on a certain scale , übergeben that machine , and the machine makes it a little bit better , better and faster than we could possibly do .
we followed the geneaologie eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we gave people to the people with radioactive things about it , they would admit that it was one of the people that he died because of his old age and we still killed him .
they ran like the devil to be verfolgt by this poem , and it was just that they had to get fast enough to get a sheet of paper and a pen , so that if it was through them , they could capture and capture on the sheet .
this has a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and in collaboration with scientists with scientists with these technologies , and asking questions , and the creative process , and the creative process , there &apos;s all kinds of things .
the first project we did as an international team , as we were aware of ourselves , o.k , we are now here as real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re going to know the people who are always doing this way and so forth .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and with this sentence , i want to conclude , a and again to give you a hint , also designers have to think differently to come to new solutions , and in this sense thank you very much for your attention .
this is actually a beautiful thing , if you do that , so agriculture does , biogas , biogas , on a hectare of a country with five thousand people in favelas , can make a farmer about eintausendfünfhundert dollars and the plant , and the anlage and the fish and the fish and the fish .
here they have this zensor between the unbewussten and the conscious , which immediately anspringt , without that they can do something about it , and the things that you know , that they can look very different for them and others .
these may be a moderaten contribution , and if they do better than i expect , that would be great , but my kernaussage here is that we have to work on all of these five , and we can &apos;t give them up because they all have significant problems .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate a rational simulate whether it was going to work , but since then modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see , yes ! with the right materialienherangehensweise , it looks like this .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo-effekt , and it may seem strange that a magician is interested in this , because , you look at it as i &apos;m saying , &quot; a deception that it is , when someone believes it . &quot;
so where the founding cleverness were very eager to figure out how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we get more mothers in this concept , we can make more a concept , not just how to protect , but how we can engage for each other .
in fact , i noticed the biggest part of my career , and this is all about trying to study social groups that are compelling and interesting , and hopefully a kind of understandable , what makes them worthwhile for the audience and accessible .
and the study of president lobo , was that the confidence of the durchsetzung that i thought was going to be a way of getting the foreign investment and building the city for all the parties for a lot of years , for many years under fear and mistrust .
but i remember the lights of the ölplattform coast of the coast of the coast , and on the young man , the zusammenbrach and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apfels , which gave me one of the men on the platform .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year off , and work to work in an environment that &apos;s pretty much everything that &apos;s going on , we &apos;ve done it in the government .
the next couple of weeks , i was waiting for the first time , and i first learned the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you can &apos;t talk to because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it better ? &quot; the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we all just talk about one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s have this language yoruba . let &apos;s be kantonesisch .
there are some pilotprojekte , which is a 60 percent -- 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to be 100 percent very difficult , and it &apos;s going to be very difficult . and a handle for the footprint is a big challenge .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s the smart thing when you get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have the things that , if things are getting faster , or that innovation needs more than that .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you can make that the erlebende self is a bad deal , and you &apos;ve got it to be a much better deal , because now you &apos;ve got a better story about your experience .
i just had to do a lot of work , and i had to repeat with these big , ambitious bändern -- in different colors -- you know , to build my bein-muskeln , and i hated this tube more than anything else . i hated her . i hated her . i hated her .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and most of all , like us , in the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
so the tedtalk was in a very simple form that a city of a city is a place where it &apos;s beginning to be the beginning of unbewohntes land , a gründungsvertrag , the laws that are leading to the laws , and the people who have the opportunity to decide , either in these rules .
now in the world of sparens , i think one of the best examples that has come to the market recently on the market , how to keep the choices , was something that david laibson has very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
i wanted to go back to routine , and the comfort of the life of an unknown vororts -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who had abschlossen every one of their days , as they &apos;ve been told for 20 years , and einschliefen the stories of their day .

&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; something that my friends call autodesk , &quot; infinite-computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers , that allow it to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , treibstoffe and künstliche , digital medicine , digital medicine .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical göttliches creatures , believed that it was literally alive in the walls of a künstlerateliers -- about like dobby , the hauself -- the rauskäme and the artist in the work of the work .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- about all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no more space for the bureaucratic creatures .
and problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a zugangsproblem , which , like things that can simplify things , a question , a question , a question , and how do you do it differently ?
and then just came from the do-it-yourself-bio website of the founder , and said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got to meet , even real , also real , &quot; and then has two events organized , one in london , zweitausend 10 , and a long time , in san francisco .
this is if you focus a laser beam on a room in the room , then you can capture little particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then you move into that focus , so , like , like , this is a traktorbeamstrahl in principle .
i was scared , not meinetwegen , but i was afraid that i could lose it in one of his states , and that i could destroy him his relationship with the violin , if i started to talk about scale and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didaktischen .
i wrote this piece , &quot; avatar , &quot; which is the messlatte effects of visual effects and computergenerierter effects in all of new heights , with realistic human , fragile characters that had been produced by cg , and the hauptfiguren should be alle .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermalquellen , and sometimes things i &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had seen before , and for the science at the time , when we saw them , didn &apos;t even find words .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think relatively often in the relationship of how often i think about others .
so what you got was this : you presented your tedtalk here : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what the theme is going to be , and the one that &apos;s ever going to give you the answer to the ears , especially , when i was making your company stupid .
so using color , contrast , contrast , contrast to the edges of the edges of the single set , photographic brides , like feldtiefe , entsättigte colors and disorders , we have the limits between the different images , and it &apos;s a single photograph , although a picture basically can contain hundreds of levels .
and when these people came and looked , who is the best protein-ordner of the world , it wasn &apos;t a mit-professor , it wasn &apos;t a caltech-student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working at the day of the world &apos;s war .
the computervision-algorithmen have taken these pictures together , and they put them in the real space , where these images that were all near the grassi of the grassi in the canadian rockies . you see these elements of stabilisierten slides , or panoramischer , and these things were all related in relation to each other .
but if we look at these metabolic bodies , which is very simple , compared to our own , trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we &apos;re looking at all of these genes that we can eliminate , it &apos;s very unlikely that this is a living cell .
but we didn &apos;t even know if we &apos;re hearing somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of speech for so long time . kind of , we have the idea of the notion , and so we have the notion that creativity and suffering , of course , leads to the -- always leads to the seelenqual .
in other people , she wasn &apos;t fast enough to paint , and she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and she would crash the poem through her , and she said she would go on to a different poet , and she said , &quot; look , after another poet . &quot;
well , not exactly what i hoped to do , but i went to go -- the stairs up , the hallway along the hallway , the &quot; real &quot; feuerwehrmännern &quot; which was so much done at this point , in the bedroom around a few shoes .
another example , a few years ago , i got the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as young , as young as young , he had sex with his girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had just figured out he had a gebärmutter and a uterus .
so we have a situation where , depending on our science , we have to admit so much that these categories that we &apos;ve been given for stable categories , which made very simple levels of information , are much more simple than we &apos;ve done .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for instance , in iran &apos;s case , where a man who feels sexually different to other men , who are punished by death , because it &apos;s ready to get a geschlechtsumwandlung , in which case he can stay alive .
we have this lebensplan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to make a hand , and it didn &apos;t do all the fences that i wanted to make , all the experiences i wanted to do .
but in fact , we &apos;re seeing more and more and more and more , that if they &apos;re willing to be too narrow , and they &apos;re going to get the möglichkeiten possibilities , well , then there &apos;s a rise of sales , it will reduce the cost , &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
it &apos;s friday , friday , friday , get down on friday , everybody &apos; , everybody forward to the weekend , weekend . , friday , friday , friday . you wouldn &apos;t think that we were going to take this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
how often are we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we prefer , and we expect the government to reflect our values , and we don &apos;t have a lot of changes ?
the reason is , if i draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years of a kind , so the timeline of a kind , and this is a random number of the technology that i want to share with a graph , which is the graph silly .
and where you &apos;re going to see how far we were going , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are that we are at all the earth , you can see that , for example , there is a program , for 20 miles , you want to be here , right ?
and our goal was , we wanted to go to 70 to 50 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest of the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which will be very , very expensive , and it won &apos;t work , that it &apos;s going to make it from batteries .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are just three fingers down here : because the mind and the way it works information is not just one , it doesn &apos;t count one , two , three , three .
well , i like to be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite do i have on the zehren of memories , but even if you have more of that , you have a real question . why do we give a lot of weight to the weight that we give ?
in our desire , to protect people who are at heart and giving them the cool , hard truth about their medical presentations , or even a forecast to the quality of life they expect , we need to make sure that someone is actually disabled .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideenreichtum , with which you bring new elements into the game -- like the testicles -- and also , as the game gives you a lot of trust , as it is at the same time .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually to use a new kind of network that was used all over the world -- this is a mobiltelefonnetz -- and anonymous and anonymous and aggregierte information from this network that will be collected from the phone .
but there &apos;s only one company , an agency ready to help us -- and also , because i know john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years -- i found that i had to do it alone , i had to go to the school and go to the companies with my team .
so , in a study that i did in a study i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro , we &apos;ve done a study with people at ing -- employees that have been working for ing -- and these people were all in a gathering where they signed their participation .
these older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr , stevenson , you talk , you &apos;re talking to talks . they tell people that they should stop saying that we should have to do it for the first time in our nation . &quot;
in about 20 years of medical science , and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study on medical errors and wrong treatments to make all kinds of things that i think of for the toronto star , &quot; white coat , black style , &quot; written to learn .
i think a signifikanter -- not the only , but a signifikanter beiträger to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned the serbian because their standards are so high . and then , if they have to explain these experiences themselves , think about it .
a group of ankara i &apos;ve met a while ago , which is a studentengruppe , which would like to give a sense of the public , what they wanted to do in college , which is what they learn in college , and they tried to explain to people what &apos;s wrong .
many of you will know the story , because from steves articles , it became a book that was wiederum , with robert downey junior and jamie foxx , as nathaniel lopez and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony , and he was very promising early to his paranoide and tragischerweise early .
bill gates : to make the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists what we &apos;ve done , we just need some 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it &apos;s safe , you &apos;re just in the 100en million .
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a frage-und-antwort-sitzung in one of my lectures , who was a story . &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said he heard he heard a symphony , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and he was a fürchterliches kreischendes sound .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush as a center of the verzweigungen in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all of the existierenden on the tips of these branches , they have been survived ; they have survived ; it has überlebt and starches .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could give you a lot more about the sense and the many other wonderful things that you can make with sense , but i want to come to talk to the second part of the second part that we talked about , and this is the betätigung of our environment .
many companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- to avoid things that you &apos;re not sure you &apos;re going to avoid , you &apos;re afraid , those elements , and that they are heißen , and they actually transform them into something positive , and it &apos;s a geschickter schachzug .
but what happens is , 17 markenpartner , who were willing to give up on these control , who wanted to do business with somebody who was doing business and error , like me , and then finally befähigten stories to tell stories that we might not have been able to support .
this is a rekonstruktion of the cathedral , dame dame , who &apos;s just in the computer with the images of flickr , and just give you notre dame in flickr , and you &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the universitätsgelände , and so on , each of these orange orangefarbenen represents a picture that was discovered as this model .
you know ? i think to allow a mild person that he thinks he or she is like the gourd , like the pelvis and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unbekanntem , infinite , unendlichen .
people at the back or the ones who eventually see on video will say , &quot; well , yeah , it looks quite impressive , but if it would be real , but if it was real , you know , it would be a hole , and it would be , you know , it would bleed . &quot;
this may seem a little bit more abwegig , so again i can do it , so that if we can do problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we &apos;re trying to play games for at least 21 billion hours a week .
it would be great if we have this paradigm of the normal versus a different of the possibilities or the strength to even make it a little bit dangerous , so we can give the forces of very many kids , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bakterielles chromosome . it has more than 580.000 letters genetic code . so we thought we &apos;d build it in tapes of the size of the virus .
and then , in part , if you look at the software we &apos;ve seen , then you will understand why neunundneunzig percent of our current software is little bit more intuitive or not available to anhieb , which is i-pad in many areas or i-phone , although it &apos;s more intuitive than classical software .
and so i ended up looking at the people who were interested in space and doing the nasa , and they &apos;re doing right now , and they &apos;re doing right weltraummissionen . they &apos;re going to russia , they go to russia , go back to the mission of the biomedizinische , and take our 3d-kamerasysteme .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the draper prize for francis arnold and willem stemmer , two scientists who are independent of the natural process of evolution to promote the natural process of evolution .
if i show you 600 papers , and i put them in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and that in 20 categories , they believe that i &apos;d give you more choice and a better auswahlerfahrung than i had given you to the 600 times if i had given you 600 .
and that &apos;s when you all forget about politics and the snake at the arbeitsamt and all the other things that we really upset , is government , in the core of tim o reilly , &quot; which we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
if you ever have the opportunity to work in your städtisches , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- in fact , do it all -- you &apos;re going to see that people who are calling the government for many different problems , including , that there &apos;s a beutelratte in your house .
and from a conversation this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me permission -- he gave me permission -- his technolgie , which is called &quot; slingshot , &quot; and the many of you may have heard of it . it &apos;s the size of a kühlschranks .
no biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are short before extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet , this -- the apokalyptischste szenarium on the field of biological diversity .
and that was really , really , very bitter , and then it &apos;s in the very short phase , and that &apos;s a picture on a durchhalten , where i asked myself about 10 years , a thousand d-mark , which is , of course , grundlohn , of course , in the collective , of course , whether that &apos;s the great thing .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve figured this out -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds long . what does , you know , in a life about 600 million of them . in a month , there are about 600,000 . most of you don &apos;t leave out .
these guys have come online , but they have acquired it , for example , by using trojaner , to attract money from our bankkonten , while we &apos;re doing our online-banking , or keylogger , who have collected our kredikarteninformationen on the keyboard , while we &apos;re going to shop over a infected computer .
you know , one of the great vernügen at traveling and one of the pleasure in the ethnographischen research , with the people who can still remember the old days . they still touch their past in the wind , taste them in the bitter leaves of the plants .
if one didn &apos;t say that , it was the vetoprinzip , which has a completely zermürbt . i &apos;ve got a lot of time doing it , whether i could really get my husband involved in a schwachsinnige , because all the colleagues of my father , you know , you &apos;ve got the money for your child .
this equation has four factors , a little bit of a multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 , which you want to get towards zero , and that will depend upon the number of people that are using every single person in average , the average energy , the average energy for every service and the co2 .
we &apos;re at the cusp of amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think that we have to go back to a hundred , 300 years ago , to find a time where we have progress , in which we have focused on these things where we &apos;re going to fight over these things .
a few years ago , the nasa scientist was giving birth to the study of his research in which he took an adult hautzelle , a fibroblasten , and through the manipulation of only four genes that the cell tied to a velociraptor -- a cell potentially in your body .
and i once traveled to a young colleague of 6,000 miles of chengdu in westchina überland by südost-tibet , and i saw the face of the statistics from the statistics that i was hearing from the statistics of the statistics that were being killed . 6,000 sacred monuments , which were being murdered in the cultural revolution .
what i &apos;m going to do first , as quickly as possible as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we have as a part of a übernahme right in front of a year , and it &apos;s a umgebung , and it &apos;s a environment where they can either deal with local or entfernt .
bruce brown , a famous designforscher on the brighton-university , is so far to say that this mass , he means the book , and the image , which is not the television , the internet , and so on , as a mass mass , the internet and so on , we have the ability to have our ability to be versteinert .
and if i put this together , for example , in which i &apos;m sighted to be considered auspräge , selektieren as a choice , it &apos;s going to come up with me , and i can look at it in the details , and , yes , i can do it somewhere , or buy someone , and so on , i can do it as well .
the first , if you &apos;re a child , as a baby , is that you &apos;re going to take care of what the ausscheidungen you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents allowed you to play more or less in the töpfchen , the more and less of your curiosity .
in the early days , i got a really amazing task when i asked my professor in harvard , whether i was interested in walking into haiti and to infiltrieren the secret societies that were the fundament of the strength of duvalier and tonton , and the poison that was used to make it possible , make sure .
bg : now we haven &apos;t set ourselves up to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting offenlegungsregeln for everything called the &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name ; there &apos;s great interest and the people of the company in russia , india , china -- i was here and talked about how this fits to the energieagenda .
it &apos;s actually this , the decisions that make sense , because if you have a patient who had two different surgeons , we have two different surgeons , and decide what he should choose to vote for , which is the less bad and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be selected .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give the best friend of the best friend , even though that one on verschwiegenheit einschwor and you get caught , and then the best friend gets confronted with this , and then the best friend leads to that you never make it again .
so , the fact that you &apos;re not remember the 20th century , in 300 years , but rather than an era , but rather than an era where we were zugegen and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity , the problem is not the change .
and they have these two bastler rangesetzt , and they said , you know , you know , we &apos;re making it easier and cheaper , and then we &apos;ve got open source , so free hardware , elektroniksachen , that this device zusammengebastelt , and are now the cheapest parts of the world .
&quot; disabled , adjektiv , hilflos , helpless , helpless , useless , destroyed , verstümmelt , verstümmelt , verstümmelt , lahm , abgetrennt , abgetrennt , kastriert , geschwächt , kastriert , kastriert , gelähmt , gelähmt , gelähmt , gelähmt , siehe , siehe , siehe , siehe , siehe , siehe , siehe , siehe , siehe .
if i had a room full of colleagues and ask their immediate support , and they started telling them what i just told you , i would probably not reach the end of the second story before it really would be awkward , someone would move a joke and forget the rest .
this idea saved me , as i was in the middle of „ eat , pray , love , and i fell in one of these constructions that we all fall in when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not going to work . you start to think that it &apos;s a disaster . it &apos;s the worst book ever written .
we also have one of these diesel-aggregate in the same size , as he &apos;s standing there , in the hall , to actually put the full dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall , it looks like this is the diesel , there &apos;s the große , there &apos;s all the time we &apos;re doing .
if i want to give you one of the things that , it &apos;s the sum of data that we consume , bigger than the sum of the parts and instead of thinking about it , i want you to think about how we can use information that &apos;s otherwise not visible .
and if you &apos;re going to choose a holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between the two species of self and you have to think about how you &apos;re going to decide this conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious , because when you think of the time , you can get a different answer .
of course , this was just a simple trick from dr. p. , so i &apos;m going to make the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that ideological five-year-old girls in the second floor are going to be in the second floor , but it actually got me to see my daily übungs-horror experience .
so this sentence , with the widrigkeiten of the idea of the idea that success depends or happiness depends on a challenge , without being connected by the experience of being connected to the experience of a life , as if my life is so successful , or whatever people can relate me to my disability .
we put the chromosome on a mikrobenspezies , and so , roughly , are these two apart from each other than humans and mice , and we gave some extra-gene that we could choose to destroy this chromosome . we &apos;d put it in a cell -- and it &apos;s really amazing when we put it in a cell -- and it &apos;s really amazing .
as i was looking for models in the past year , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or vernünftigere ideas about how to help them do better or vernünftigere ideas about creativity .

so that the system is going to be entwickelt , which makes it easier to find out , which makes people inevitable , and it enables people to create supportive spaces in which everyone who is looking at the health care , in fact , in fact , the potential , which is the potential , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be rewarded for people like me , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to reward for people like me .

usually , my role , is that we can &apos;t get the people to explain how wonderful the new technologies are at the end , and i thought , well , i &apos;m here , and i thought , i &apos;m going to tell you what i really think . and i &apos;m going to try to see what &apos;s really going on , with these incredible sprüngen , which is so fast .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my fachberater patti and my colleague , i started to wonder : what if we were going to use computers , which , if we could use computers , which is like a digital fingerspitze , which is going on like a digital fingerspitze -- what if we could do it with both the same hand , which is like a digital fingerspitze .

i &apos;m going to give you the words of a english scientist , humphrey davy , who , i suspect , when he fought the nutzlosen experiments , he was an apprentice , and he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , as to assume that our scientific ideas are going to be in nature , that our scientific notions are in nature , that our scientific notions are endgültig .
at this point , does it have to go to canada , &quot; what happens if we put a unbesiedelte surface of our country , what if we just put a message in the middle of the american embassy , a part of the middle of the world , and if people want to go to the middle of the world , what they are usually going to go to canada , what are they going to do for canada or to america ? &quot;
