don &apos;t entmutigt .
this is turbo .
the sun goes on .
the orange tractor .
yeah , hello .
fantastic , right ?
that &apos;s wrong .
long , yeah .
yeah , milliseconds .
the only chance .
nullemissionen , yes ?
it doesn &apos;t happen .
that &apos;s efficient .
all the umweltdiskussion .
not toxic inside .
but it &apos;s .
yeah , kind of .
music as language .
lento , slow .
i wonder .
that &apos;s the singing .
you need time .
a autistischer student .
it &apos;s fast .
here it is .
this is vorbildlich .
not very sustainable .
they were schlemmen . &quot;
that was fascinating .
an enormous challenge .
we need energiewunder .
thank you . thank you .
bg : thank you .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s terrible .
shame . ashamed .
it works like this .
very different term .
we know that .
dk : 60,000 .
and he says ...
a few less .
we were .
it has sensors .
i swear .
does that sound good ?
after a week .
you can get inside .
i grabbed awe awe .
thank you .
that was incredible .
no hospital .
thank you .
... not yet .
that &apos;s scary .
it &apos;s generisch .
yeah . okay .
a whole lot .
jk : both .
i can help .
i was amazed .
ban is blank .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m tom .
thank you .
i created one .
are they all ?
we lose them .
oh my god !
ohhhhh , wowwww !
there were remixe .
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
we were poor .
after home , where ?
centers were built .
my gut gut again .
that &apos;s not ...
bewerte them again .
we raise it .
i vertrete kids .
or before bombs .
it would be unerträglich .
it would be gewissenlos .
we love innovation .
we love entertainment .
oh , my god .
schlafmangel is ubiquitous .
there are online-kriminelle .
they sell zertifikate .
they durchbohrten each other .
thank you very much .
these days are over .
what do you want to do ?
they even hurt .
everybody needs a goldfischglas .
this was the result .
i find them abscheulich .
can we change it ?
just do your job .
this is the speicherbecken .
this happened by christmas .
this is the last one .
good work ! yes !
so let &apos;s see .
yeah , good afternoon .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
yeah , this is .
what are media today ?
they have similar principles .
why does that happen at all ?
does anybody see something special ?
a dalmatiner , right .
i see the dalmatiner .
that &apos;s our present .
what takes instant milliseconds ?
give pee a chance .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
let me tell you .
no tree is kohlenstoffneutral .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we can do it differently .
and it needs to go back .
wonderful , huh ?
but the wrong things .
what do you say ?
every waste is nährstoff .
so not like detox .
we can do that .
does it matter ?
the work of interpreten .
you put in comparison .
all of these things are interested in me .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
you see it immediately .
i can say everything .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
yeah , good afternoon .
this is called projektträger today .
we were 20 people .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
that &apos;s the system .
what a fish .
i wanted to encourage them .
let &apos;s call it .
that &apos;s me .
what did you do ?
they fluteten the channels .
the farm is incredible .
there &apos;s no food .
can i be honest ?
and i was an artist .
it was really profound .
who will make it safe ?
next , nuklearenergie .
that &apos;s great .
that &apos;s a wish .
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
who is the most successful ?
what was the result ?
there are also weltrekorde .
and i understand that .
people were playing crazy .
we &apos;re talking about it .
the data came in .
but you know what ?
not very often .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
pretty good , right ?
dark urine . dark .
there were no cantaloupe-melonen .
why do we do that ?
it &apos;s not a country .
because you know what ?
yeah , i know .
how do we know ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
thank you , danny kahneman .
so they do that .
it may sound bad .
players are not sitting around .
glückselige productivity . fantastic !
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
creativity emerges in creativity .
there is no normal normal .
oh , so that .
that &apos;s very good .
a few more .
what about longevity ?
maybe 10 times .
he opens the door .
why not live longer ?
these are going to be unwiderstehlich .
so it &apos;s true .
they &apos;re all important .
be a mentor .
who are these related ?
play is not silly .
so where do we go ?
ooh , thank you .
thank you very much .
first extension , second .
italy wins . yeah .
here &apos;s the video .
his name is tempt .
i stood against him .
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
they did .
that sounds fear einflößend .
you could see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
the power station can explode .
i have a question .
that would have been okay .
this is very risky .
this is the kurzfassung .
überlegene technology .
it holds you fresh .
hmmm , my brand ?
my name is amit .
i see this pluszeichen .
polite have all applaudiert .
first , narrow .
but you know what ?
how interested do you care ?
let me wrap up .
so how does this work ?
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy kimmel .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i lived in parallelwelten .
i don &apos;t know .
is it at all photography ?
what creates the illusion ?
oh , a moment .
okay . thank you .
so they meet al .
and that &apos;s important .
they use their hands .
there are two possibilities .
i &apos;m going in here .
i find this interesting .
the silence is ohrenbetäubend .
i find that fascinating .
i find that fascinating .
we &apos;re constantly stoßen .
i thought about it .
i don &apos;t think so .
that was big .
here &apos;s an example .
let &apos;s talk about wasser-kriege .
what do these people need ?
hey , why not ?
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
a thousand , very good .
i learned everything .
but i continued to work .
asked the nurse &apos;s nurse .
so she was back .
they gave her their blutdruckerhöher .
their family had gathered together .
and she did .
and i continued working .
actually , he collected fish .
it was a zackenbarsch .
what &apos;s happening here ?
this is what happens today .
we have three hauptgruppen .
these people deserve money .
this is alfred gonzalez .
diginotar is a zertifizierungsstelle .
privacy has to be given .
the stones are farbcodiert .
i &apos;ll stop that .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
the living match the spirits .
now , what does that mean ?
so what does that mean ?
jeanny nations send our fernsehkanal .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
the official dogma of what ?
these are all einnehmende questions .
here &apos;s another example .
third : eskalation of expectations .
do you want jeans with holes ?
but i felt worse .
we only have signed .
why should we do that ?
seriously -- geweiht .
and i always had that .
why not think about that ?
this is a jährlicher tauwasserfluss .
these rivers take fast .
the wassermengen have expanded .
let &apos;s leave that out .
they really loved it .
this is an interactive trickfilmanwendung .
... his own story .
so what is hacking now ?
you can see that down there .
how do we actually work people ?
that sounds unusual , basically .
they didn &apos;t have books .
let &apos;s do a little zwischenbilanz .
from the vogt-zeitalter to the maschinenzeitalter .
we &apos;re not producing anymore .
it &apos;s not going to be done .
pattern recognition was supposed to work .
now you see the dalmatiner .
a very exciting phenomenon .
you have to understand that .
this is called the osit-modell .
and it depends on phosphorus .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
the phosphor-problem is much more critical .
it makes leukemia in children .
but that &apos;s not a protection .
luckily , yes ?
so we &apos;re too many .
but where are we useful ?
we can start our nutrients back .
in china , it was different .
the byproduct is clean water .
but we need this overall .
or take a lippenstift .
there is every footprint there .
we &apos;re saying in germany .
so it &apos;s two cycles .
everything is kompostierbar of it .
that must be the altersunterschied .
he was about 60 .
his personal impressionen of seerosen .
most of you here are familiar .
this is like sprechenlernen .
because you can train .
have you ever been jealous ?
it &apos;s against justice .
it &apos;s always going to give you more and more .
it &apos;s interested in feuermachen .
there he is .
because i can say everything .
these things are logical .
it &apos;s not that soul .
this is a naturding .
this is the naturdinge presented .
it &apos;s busy with raisins .
there are four and a half thousand people living .
that &apos;s not just technological .
what would all be done ?
and here &apos;s the picture again .
and then they set up .
i just loved two .
doesn &apos;t taste very well .
to one , great .
let &apos;s also do it .
it &apos;s kind of verkuppelt us .
the chef had him verkocht .
he showed up the algae .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the futterverwertung ? &quot;
the flamingos eat shrimp .
the shrimp eat phytoplankton .
i almost never cook with it .
i don &apos;t like this question .
they want to feed the world ?
now i see greg lemond .
so they saw something magic .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what lessons do we learn ?
it &apos;s continued to continue .
first of all , we have the population .
today , 6,8 billion people live .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
the other thing that &apos;s going on .
and there &apos;s the lagerungsproblem .
that really solves the treibstoffproblem .
how should our testimony look ?
this has the biggest impact .
so what do we need to do ?
for what do i do ?
we need to spread the message .
this is just a versicherungsmethode .
and even lomborg is thinking .
it was a huge success .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and then realizing it .
i tried something interesting now .
now what do you think about ?
there &apos;s a schritt-für-schritt-anleitung there .
and why is that ?
diphterie , röteln , kinderlähmung ...
the result of that was catastrophic .
because anybody here has measles ?
so paul is a terrorist .
the data shows you all the time .
i agree with you completely .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i &apos;ll push back my sleeve .
but the key thing is , ...
yeah , here it is .
there &apos;s a lot of glücks-coaching .
but it didn &apos;t .
he had the experience .
there &apos;s an old study .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
they have so much uncertainty .
so the correlation is smaller .
it &apos;s not for emotion .
and there are lots of collaborators .
so the first aufrechte primate primate .
and ultimately , epic meaning .
they create a epic story .
edward castronova is a volkswissenschaftler .
that sounds crazy , right ?
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
the game is from 2007 .
i &apos;ll go to the end .
i want to ask you something .
i don &apos;t think so much .
how about fitness ?
is it all einbildung ?
or is it possible ?
some came and went .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
it cost 2,7 billion dollars .
these changes are coming in .
who does not want healthier kids ?
play doesn &apos;t just mean kinderspiele .
and this is called androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so what happened after that ?
and women argumentierten that successful .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
will it be my height ?
will i like the color ?
good afternoon , all together .
here you see the city .
you see the timeline the timeline .
they saw the big deal .
and then everybody went down .
it really enjoyed him .
you can have this cloud .
here you see roberto dancing dancing .
here you can see it .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
no insurance can turn out .
it turns the stones off .
i had a good life .
it feels great .
you see the water coming .
but it was very sad .
and then something funny happened .
and that worked very well .
and it got better .
but it gets worse .
is that your opinion ?
i &apos;m a redundante person .
that was more to honor .
put the camera out .
what else is more risky ?
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
that &apos;s a great question .
and this is a millionen-konzern .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . good . all right .
the add very well .
what other brands do they do ?
that &apos;s a great question .
and it took 18 months .
i grew up in india .
so you just go too fast .
just further . a lot of fun .
these are all purple .
you see something fun here .
it seemed quite popular .
they come from the artists .
the answer to that is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
again , he showed him javier .
the two call me up .
it mühelos a thousand square square miles .
one place is south korea .
here &apos;s the olive gait .
here &apos;s her marmeladen gang .
the third technique : kategorisierung .
here are two different schmuckauslagen .
okay , a few more .
what am i looking at ?
this is what the chart looked like .
and then it became international .
something versteifte in me .
loans and sponsors were searched .
so i followed my gut feeling .
after just a trip there .
is it about light ?
here &apos;s another example .
but it requires a lot of planning .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
i work in solartechnologie-branche .
it &apos;s expanding quickly .
so scott gets this anfruf .
they connected these two people .
did you see these guys ?
something very strange happens here .
that &apos;s what it looks like .
it &apos;s about it .
it has billions of them .
you might run some mutations .
but they do the job .
so it creates a rückkopplung .
that really made me sad .
but what do we do with that ?
and this opens up a map .
these are the apsaras .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
my brother starrte me .
i was devastated .
i &apos;ll tell you something .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
we &apos;ve lost touch .
the only country in the world .
i vertrete people in todeszellen .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
we love technology and creativity .
she &apos;s going to touch her deeply .
we want to eradicate masseninhaftierungen . &quot;
sometimes i blame too much .
so i went to the court .
once the judge saw me .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
crisis . disaster . disaster .
perhaps that &apos;s the reality .
and many people forget this .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
we think of energieknappheit today .
and there &apos;s good news .
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
and so it was .
i felt really good .
actually , i made two mistakes .
my second mistake was worse .
the notfallpersonal did all the strands .
and then it happened again .
he always showed up here .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
the other one had a strong diarrhea .
and it &apos;s the crux .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
my name is brian goldman .
it &apos;s about veränderbare normwerte .
it was my first sonnenbrand .
adults measure five centimeters .
they were genetically erdrückt .
it was still fish .
this is a dead turtle .
once we started living .
she wasn &apos;t ertrunken yet .
it &apos;s not being documented .
you always lose rare animals .
what do you do with zertifikaten ?
the firmenhauptquartier is right here .
they tap their internet connection .
privacy is not a debate .
so littlebits open source .
they &apos;re the heimatländer of somebody .
our magazines are read by millions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
a has these benefits and risks .
it &apos;s all just to have .
the answer is yes .
second , what economists call oppertunitätskosten .
they could have done better .
so let me remind you .
economists call this a pareto-verbesserungs application .
we &apos;ve created unique elements here .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
there &apos;s huge jubel in the control room .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
okay , that &apos;s what &apos;s really going to do .
so , you know .
so the question is : how ?
what is this thing ?
go and quäle leonard cohen .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
the dauereis is tagged with red .
this is a completely unhaltbares entwicklungsmuster .
this picture reminded me of something .
this is what he &apos;s doing .
now , i add a bass .
was a pretty schickes project project .
or they didn &apos;t have any fotolitografie .
no , no , sorry .
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is a game for outside .
for example , this perception in context .
does anybody know what that is ?
so it &apos;s n circle .
this is also a paradigm paradigm .
then i can transmit this whole thing .
you can &apos;t have teeth .
we depend on two countries .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
on the urine of the urine .
there &apos;s no überbevölkerungsproblem of trees .
and we &apos;re too many .
imagine mozart efficient .
that &apos;s the minimum line .
not all of them should be natural .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
technical kreisläufe is exactly the same .
when it &apos;s in the moment .
i started a institute .
so basically , a translation of translation .
the beweggründe , it &apos;s writing .
how and what does he expect ?
have a nice example of that .
this is a getragenes part .
because for me it &apos;s memory .
now , the instruments have been fortentwickelt .
it was just not invented .
do you know what envy is ?
and how did that feel ?
i &apos;m shooting something through the head .
the mechanism is from lying .
picasso says , just wait .
my wife told me it .
here you have this little mechanism .
we can &apos;t just do that .
and then he can davonlaufen .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i hervorgehoben him here .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
he automatically runs to the right thought .
again , you have it again .
and you have a problem .
thank you for your attention .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
can &apos;t be a problem .
natürlicht then offers smart-grid .
so smart-grid , a riesenthema everywhere .
and of course , this is incredibly expressive .
this is going to happen next april .
for nathaniel , music means seelische health .
i hope you forgive me .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i said , &quot; hühnchen-pellets ? &quot;
i entliebte from this fish .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and green was a disaster .
they literally umgelegt the lever .
schlemmen ? i was completely confused .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
he shook his head , no .
this is a ökologisches network .
a billion people are starving today .
creativity had to be kind of out .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
so i made the film .
they live with help from chemosynthese .
it really changed the dynamic .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
in fact , the fortschrittsgesellschaft is based on energiefortschritten .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
so this is a hard place .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
this is going to be a key component of this .
under other things , other things should not suffer .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
they don &apos;t invest time in machtkämpfe .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
my grandparents defy this number .
we &apos;ve got them bezwungen . packaging .
so that &apos;s the good news .
the same thing , just bigger .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
and that kind of confused me .
don &apos;t take anything else .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
nobody said that before .
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
we &apos;re zooming in nahrung food .
and why ? gentechnisch food .
it &apos;s like a potato .
because we don &apos;t want to herumschieben genes ?
the dose also plays a role .
and the shape is playing a role .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
what is a story that draws out ?
they didn &apos;t change the story .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
but it &apos;s definitely not a optimalsituation .
so this crazy story could be true .
so , we can do that too .
i read the post .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
widrigkeiten are just to our lives .
honestly -- who is normal ?
i really wanted to be normal .
the students are divided into grades .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
what would you love most ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
now , how could that happen ?
and this was 19 years ago .
well , i was the next one .
the hauptmann winkte me .
but the game is a formwandler .
both of them are überlebensfähig .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tiger .
monday : color is a bit powerful .
tuesday : adaptation is totally überbewertet .
thursday : confidence is the key .
they become a computer in free .
on the morning , before the game .
the game starts -- silence .
the data was not available before .
the entire building was out of water .
but reality is always unpredictable .
they can play with different ways .
it &apos;s about five feet long .
and this video is in real time .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
we won a few awards .
this is a picture of a circle .
she did it for three years .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
so we start with a windows-dropper .
this is a piece of paper , right ?
and there &apos;s a whole goal .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s just the arbeitstitel .
we need to think about what brands .
that would have been no problem at all .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
a whole bowl of cool food .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
these things have a positivere effect .
how would you describe your brand ?
i really like to enjoy beautiful clothes .
lawyer : i &apos;m a anwaltsmarke .
tell me about this world .
what else do they have through ?
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
the film hasn &apos;t yet been dumped .
you go around and amüsiert .
you want to synchronize in the museum ?
this is one of the images .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is a picture of the object .
and we did that .
so we measured its movement .
we &apos;re in a field .
this picture is from this place .
they even bring money to money .
think of your own decisions .
now we saw the opposite effect .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
here &apos;s a description of the road .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
this is a profoundly unnützes kategorisierungsschema .
who do you actually want to know ?
we need to slow down complexity .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
well , then we want to do that .
he had a lot of naturvideos uploaded .
what &apos;s going on that day ?
that &apos;s it , just .
someone made an old-fashioned version of it .
who could have done this ?
the story is not over .
i never met him personally .
no one was ever an option .
her mother just moved her .
the defeat would have been too simple .
who would ever want to wish ?
i thought everybody could .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and nevertheless , a realistic level .
sometimes the perspective is illusion .
the unterwasser-teil is from a quarry .
how can we help you ? &quot;
and every morning i swam .
and we created a ipad-app .
so , you know , it &apos;s giving you attention .
this is a modest little app .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
in boston , not only does it have a call-center .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
good night , cute beutelratte . &quot;
so the occupythesec-bewegung did .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
but it &apos;s not that fast .
we &apos;re not going to go further than that .
so what &apos;s next ?
and these are the neural structures .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
it &apos;s verworrene and strange programs .
so , gewissermassen überflügelt the technology .
we &apos;re in the middle of this übergangpunkt .
now we do that with airplanes .
i was scared of technology .
it used to be more understood .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
somehow the children do not do anymore .
we use the energy of the sun .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
she was a daughter &apos;s daughter .
i should not do that .
this is perhaps going to be übertragen .
my uncle died of alkoholinduzierten diseases .
many of my clients are very young .
this is a very sensitive question .
i talk a lot about these questions .
do you want to listen and listen ? &quot;
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
you should also wish for the wanting .
then he went to the ear .
well , i walked the gerichtssaal .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
&quot; a pale blue harbor . &quot;
because we live on a wasserplaneten .
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-milliarden-marke .
we have the passion of a diy-innovatoren .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropen .
we expect some remarkable decades .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
it &apos;s the durchschnittsleistung of the schlägers .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
but , you know what ?
i was a zwanghaft student .
she was back and die .
but slowly , it turns out .
i started feeling better .
alone , taste and without support .
but there are two problems .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
all of these are errors driven .
and it starts with a physician .
it shares your experience with others .
i &apos;m the new defining doctor .
people were still happy .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be aufzuregen .
zertifizierungsbehörde hacken , ausstellen zertifikate .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument makes no sense .
lego made it possible for everyone .
and it was an incredible experience .
and of course , we all share the same anpassungsnotwendigkeiten .
a language is expression of human mind .
54 percent of deaths happened by durchbohrungen .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
so you can &apos;t do anything like that .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
now let &apos;s get something else .
many of them are covered by faces and so forth .
this is my supermarket . no big .
and there are several reasons for this .
here &apos;s some on the hamptons .
everybody in my manhattener neighborhood is gone .
now , this cartoon makes some tell some people .
the truth is more like this .
we started 15 years ago .
it turns out it &apos;s very difficult .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
this is the hauptmechanismus of evolution here .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
we konditionierten them , they reparierten .
like algae -- and other furchteinflößende things .
if you don &apos;t , anybody else today .
his whole arbeitsprozess has changed .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
it &apos;s about a neuversorgung of america .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
so for him , they were just bauklötze .
we wanted to develop a lernmittel for sprachlerner .
so , that was my primary motivator .
and the list you can continue to go away .
it &apos;s longer than these other two networks .
and that &apos;s really the beginning .
now , what are actually really archaische models ?
so i want to show you a little bit about this .
this is what happened to be gennante maschinenzeitalter .
on the book and on the picture .
we have an abstract language .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
you may have a look at it again .
so from modern to the computergesellschaft .
every society is shaped by a primärmedium .
at the beginning of the speech , through the language .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
often in the third , again .
you &apos;ll see from the back to the front .
i don &apos;t know who you see .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
it only has to process as a present .
how do i make something more like this ?
and less usable or benutzungsfreundlich is it .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
i &apos;m going to try this through a beispiels .
it &apos;s a lot of cake .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , verbrauche less energy .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
and everything is packaging , or content .
a baby needs about six windeln windeln .
so with that , men can &apos;t be pigs .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
that means we need to zurückkriegen phosphorus .
but all of a sudden , yes ?
that &apos;s why not efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
in the north , we think of the north .
so don &apos;t save , clean , avoid avoid .
you can show me , i was there .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown right now .
there &apos;s this direct rücknamesystem .
if you go to that , yes ?
all over the place , these grooves are around , almost .
we can reinvent everything else .
so each concert is another concert .
and he said , &quot; well , that &apos;s what ?
he &apos;s lived only neununddreißig years .
it &apos;s not going to talk about interpretation of interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
say that what you feel .
it &apos;s not just a nice geräuschtapete .
and that sounds very different than that .
so the first step to take a interpretation .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
because now you can use a dreisatz .
you &apos;re still familiar with school .
in this dreisatz , three sentences come .
and you can feel it here .
so he &apos;s in the middle .
these sentences are absolutely logical and accurate .
say , there &apos;s no vorhersager .
there &apos;s the kernforschungsanlage leopoldshafen .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
you think of a box .
we also get very specific data .
how far do you get there ?
and then we said , &quot; okay .
pretty simple , it &apos;s going to come .
so i just started playing .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and so he entflieht his quälenden condition .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
they have the water of the water pyramid .
here he picks up a rare gleitaar .
now he said the mineralbedürfnisse of phytoplankton .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
a fischaufzucht , but also a vogelreservat .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
it &apos;s this beißende , verkohlte taste .
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
you can dive into a particular year .
we &apos;re talking about the informationsüberflusses of the informationsüberflusses .
so i &apos;m listening to that , thank you very much .
i was totally wissenschaftsbegeistert , you know .
i could draw . i could paint .
but i didn &apos;t let me get frustrated .
so , sort of verflochten my two passions .
so , that really blew me up .
we went back to the train of titanic .
so that was a very strange experience .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
and for energy , i fell this .
so here are some natural fireflies .
it should have the two elements again .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
we need to use more research for research .
anyway , we need a solution .
bg : a energiedurchbruch is the most important thing .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
but there &apos;s another reason .
because they have special skills of prozessbegleitung .
what do you think happened with these design-studenten ?
we went through this exercise with the same students .
and that can make a big difference .
and everybody in this room must be in .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
not even the truth will be free .
we now have measles in this country .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we &apos;re walking into the poor of the placebo-industrie .
they go to thabo mbeki in south africa .
that has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s quite , morality , patentkram .
so , look what happens .
and the goal is very simple .
i think the knife in my hand .
what ? that really drew me .
i would usually pull out the needle .
everybody would like to make people happier .
he had 20 minutes of herrlicher music .
and this is a very simple question .
there seems to be a pathogen .
we get an absolutely flat line .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
no , i mean it really is serious .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
so we have a whole 1.5 billion player .
five million people are using it every month .
in front of these amazing spielecontrollern , there were schafsknöchel .
people suffered . people fought .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
here &apos;s the aktualisierte version of this eintrags .
we can give ourselves something ourselves .
maybe we can see widrigkeiten as a change .
but what &apos;s going on in the future ?
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
i remember my first fire .
and do you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
intersexualität comes in many different forms .
so we have this awful vereinfachende idea .
they had a concept of blue blood .
we see the same thing in the behindertenrechtsbewegung .
how do you judge people because of their charaktereigenschaften ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
do we really want to go to that direction ?
there are no states of that kind of thing .
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
be just who you are .
wednesday : take your inner child .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
let &apos;s start with feeling .
it came out four and a half years ago in italy .
it was when italy won the fußball-weltmeisterschaft .
and no matter , italy won &apos;t win at the end .
second halbzeit . the end of normal play .
zidane , in a moment of kopfstoß .
we called it the digital water pavillion .
the roof was covered with water as well .
you can do that all the time .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
but the truth is far away .
this is the average size of a grönland-eisbergs .
and that was the outbreak of the act .
he can only use his eyes .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
this is something like our kampfschrei .
it all comes from our own pockets .
and i had to go out of town .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
he says , &quot; bereitmachen for effect . &quot;
and that &apos;s the planning behind stuxnet .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
okay , you want to know that ?
i went to jail -- difficult .
the goal of all the film is transparency .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
with which words would you describe ban ?
man 3 : i &apos;m the schmusetyp .
man 5 : brand gescheiteter alkoholsüchtiger
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i like things that are different .
the first one is a classic apple .
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
are they achtsam and mondän like 007 ?
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
emc : welcome to transparency
thank you , but the best thing is coming .
you can get very easily and rauszoomen .
but then you really want to go deep .
another lieblingsbild of mine , sternennacht .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
it &apos;s just to make precise zeitpunkten voices .
the rest of the time is delokalisiert .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
that &apos;s more than 250 a morning .
also , städtedesigner and -bauer are very interested .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
and i want to read to you the ones .
my fourth technology : embrace complexity .
oh my god . oh my god .
really didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
even cats look at this video .
nobody needs to give your ideas green .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
no apple ever tasted again .
my mother suffered from alpträumen from the boat .
i was not familiar with the etikette .
there had to be another puzzlestück .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a dime .
we worked until late .
her father died soon after her birth .
&quot; they didn &apos;t get rid of them . &quot;
the second one should have put together the same thing .
the bank is from a different place .
we &apos;ve all got navigationssysteme in our cars .
and sure , we can find fastfood-ketten .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
oh , my time is over ?
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
and that worked . for scott applause .
scott selinger to human beings .
beutelratte ? yes . alive ? yap .
so each tröpfchen was a little different .
the zellengemeinschaften began to abstrahieren information again .
it could take action in a time of time .
speichere these , lösche , the rest of the rest .
i tried to understand them .
with 16 , i started explaining books .
it can know where we are .
i learned this from my grandmother .
there are some hochinteressante developments .
we have a lot of work running .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
i think our identity is threatened .
we want to do something against the death penalty company .
we want to lower the number of death rates .
i &apos;m going to get tired , like all of us .
he came to me and umarmte me .
that i had written these crazy things .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
it was the fehlgeleitete kreuzzug against drugs .
but maybe this is not the case .
child mortality has about a tenth of child mortality .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and we &apos;re increasing our expectations constantly .
now look at this curve .
notice two things on this curve .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
the king of siam had got aluminium-besteck .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silikate .
what will bring these three billion people ?
so far , this has been a problem for supercomputers .
you know how to call a 400ter ?
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
and there is feedback to my oberarzt .
maybe i did it with good reason .
they barely breathe and was blue angelaufen .
she closed her to the beatmungsmaschine .
she had no behandelbaren gehirnschaden .
this is the kind of lehrreicher shame .
but i asked these questions .
why went to medicine ?
in one thought , i thought he would have nierensteine .
it &apos;s a totally denial of errors .
i thought i could integrate myself .
so , if you do it , this is what happens .
the difference is then seen as a loss .
there can be a sequence of changes .
that &apos;s exactly our goal now .
so , you don &apos;t often lose traditional animals .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
but western governments are also helping themselves .
but today we are far beyond it .
we &apos;ve also brought littlebits .
the ethnosphäre is the great legacy of humanity .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
it &apos;s our new public and it &apos;s called nunavut .
every major image is the beginning of a abschnitts .
or other models , or even technical meditators .
übereinandergelagert on the erdräumlichen image of nasa .
there are which much more powerful .
i &apos;m very grateful for the brush here .
yes . it doesn &apos;t matter anything else .
the official glaubenssatz of all western industrialized societies .
i just want to briefly say something about salatdressing .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
in other areas , the world of communication .
we &apos;re not erben , we invent them .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
i could park right before my house . &quot;
i wear jeans , almost the whole time .
they worry about that for worse .
they increase the paralysis and happiness .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it &apos;s a little virus killing bacteria .
they laughed more than they did here .
so , this looks like a basketball-playoff .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it has over 300 million .
it will provide a challenge for nine .
we take images of these mini-urknalle in detectors .
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
oh , jesus , what a thought !
everybody knew their genius was a bit executed .
it was about the land on them .
if your job is dancing , tanze .
and if not , still your dance dance .
it grows in the winter and it accelerates in summer .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland .
but we start to see change .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news news .
frosty , the kohlenmann will be clean every day .
this is one of them .
saueber coal , they &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean kohletechnologie .
versorge america . find out more .
we have to go far , and it &apos;s fast .
and these interactive portraits are true each other .
and they also feel their movements and slope .
this is our youngest beta-tester down there .
now he gets a tractor into the scene .
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit of drums .
i can turn the sequence into it .
i &apos;m really excited that i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
as i said , it &apos;s only begun .
and that &apos;s what they do .
now , if you keep thinking a little bit further .
but i &apos;m going to talk to you again .
and then the einflüsse of vorindustriellen cultures .
what remained left is the storytelling .
i just want to explain a little bit about this .
and the two letzteren are also here today .
a forschungssemester to the subject of natural users interface .
to say , what is information ?
and further , you see it always .
that &apos;s what it says to the norm .
and there &apos;s a central point .
so , of course , we can look at the müllproblem .
that &apos;s balanced in china in a second .
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s done with , right ?
have you ever seen a klimaneutralen tree ?
we can support them to be good .
that means that the verbrechensraten goes back .
we can support them to be good .
and we see that it works .
but you can &apos;t replace phosphorus .
if you fall in love with somebody ?
so i say , herzliches beileid , yes ?
but with the right design , please .
in two hours , they &apos;re building all over the place .
do you remember the windel ?
it &apos;s sort of a beneficial poop print .
and in my jugendlichkeit , i said , expectation .
the x-malige interpretation of a piece is like this .
especially if he died .
a phrase to make his own breath .
because the music is the extension of our body .
because artists have a gestörtes relationship with lie .
because we cannot live without those lebenslüge .
a particularly beautiful story , like i am .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell a story about reality .
we can continue these things to different examples .
gleichgroße forces with gegensätzlichem vorzeigenzeichen solving each other .
and in berlin , there was a crazy ingenieurkollektiv .
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we have 30 gigawatts today in germany .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violinkonzert .
it &apos;s hard to überbewerten the destruction .
he has a futterverwertung of 15 to one .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your bäuche , pink .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly 240 kilometers .
i mentioned this against miguel and he was nickte .
let &apos;s instead look at the ecological model .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
you can jump directly into a particular copy .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
as a child , i was constantly recording books and so .
i was really obsessed with studying the deep sea .
these blöden films don &apos;t bring us any money .
there &apos;s a connection , a collision respect .
so what can we close from all this ?
it &apos;s also very important for them .
isn &apos;t half the or a quarter ? &quot;
it &apos;s great that this number is rising .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
and what do you do with the waste ?
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve summarized .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this topic .
in nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
you can predict that . why is that ?
they run the process , they understand it .
i thought we &apos;re going to bring the pokereinsatz .
there was never a time before that .
my ur-großeltern died all of them as they were 60 .
my parents are the 80 to the fersen .
anybody still knows what that is ?
this is skandalös and we should be ashamed .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
the guy in the middle not so much .
and they won &apos;t only die of measles .
we had no kinderlähmung in this country yesterday .
have you all taken your vitamins tomorrow ?
this is great . i love the placebo-industrie .
and i have all kinds of little requisiten here .
and you know what ? they have wrong .
they have them . they &apos;ve always got them .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t work .
we get rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
-- that also the dosierungen play a role .
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
people in the nebenräumen are now coming in .
well , the erinnernde itself is a storyteller .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
thank you . i have a question to you .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil toledano .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
this player is just a epischen victory victory .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
players are experts in the spiders of social nets .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
what do you think happens next ?
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
and then , of course , it did take click .
come on dance with me . thank you very much .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130.000 years .
it &apos;s a beautiful spärlich showgirl showgirl .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to restore health after a disease .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
in berkeley , we call these robots exoskelette .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
as i said , amanda carries our elegs .
he stole every fünkchen hope from my consciousness .
the dog ! i was lost against envy .
well , chimps are known for their aggressivität .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
play is the kitt that beieinanderhält us .
look at what she does .
in other words , play is our anpassungsjoker .
so two pairs , every zeugt , a baby .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
so testosterone , but no reaction to that .
they are in the back part of our body .
he had an extreme form of angeborenen nebennierenrindenhyperblasie .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
they moved to a naturalistischen concept .
but how do you do that in practice ?
so i think we need to be leaders .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
well , we presented the mayor of belloch .
here you see the building working .
i want to show you something here first .
it &apos;s at the same time , and a bewegungsaufnahme .
so you can feel the whole movement .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
as an artist , i think it &apos;s very important .
normal people are not available . &quot;
make it possible -- all of you here .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a geräuschloses aircraft .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bordpersonal anymore .
i never want to move anything in life .
they even knew the schuhgröße of the maschinenbedieners .
looks pretty much like old-fashioned assemblersprache .
so that made sense , it made sense .
so again , that &apos;s really passte .
it &apos;s natanz and it &apos;s just natanz .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressiver .
so this is where we need digital sicherheitssysteme .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
i &apos;ve been working in a kohlebergwerk -- dangerous .
no , that was what i thought .
it &apos;s unvorhersagbar -- like this strange landstraße .
i want to help you calm down .
you want to tell me something about my brand .
all right , what is the brand gerry ?
i sell schmusetiere throughout the country .
tell me a little bit about this part .
we should put the bear in the cage .
and finally , we should be welcome to transparency .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
i &apos;ve got him here on my laptop . &quot;
so , to the theme of the day , savings is saving .
well , who is ready for this trip .
because it &apos;s not we really feel money .
in 2010 , it had been seen 23 million times .
well , it was friday , right ?
i want to tell you about some of the puzzlestückchen .
but so many got over the years .
life had not changed for centuries .
&quot; it &apos;s not &quot; erwies . &quot;
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
if i say reality , i foto-realität .
and here &apos;s a piece of very well planned .
she &apos;s got a button .
i have my job in 95 lbs .
next week , this is coming on the market .
we have herumgefragt , and nobody knew it .
it might take up until it &apos;s geladen .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
today , a lot of people have given up the government .
this is the call-center for service and information .
but that was not the end of the beutelratten .
that our contribution to the system is choosing .
and we use this word with such contempt .
... could you just show the slide for a moment .
all the things that were like were aufzuteilen .
the dna model of dna was an interesting step .
so the next step happened within these communities .
so we have the zeitskalen again .

and that was not a hard diagnostic diagnosis .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the hilfsbedürftige doctor .
and i went back to work .

and that was what i felt .
it was a lot , and i &apos;m in a hurry .
it turns out he was a streptokokken-infektion .

i &apos;m a person . i make mistakes .
yet , we still get to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
they &apos;re still starting to describe as v-day .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
they &apos;re getting fewer , because we &apos;ll start them .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
you can &apos;t put them wrong with them .
you just listen to and start talking .
we &apos;re dancing in the temple , and we &apos;re going to become god . &quot;
and the problem is not the technology .
we had to make it because of the lawyers and so forth .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
if you want to make them , it &apos;s between the images .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . thank you so much .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
but niederlassen is not always a bad thing .
your problem is that you have too little .

and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself-bio harbor org , d.i.y.bio .
and then we &apos;ve been able to make a code-of-conduct .
it &apos;s a reality , and it &apos;s not a computer .
and in this mind , the memory was played .
the fundamental tool in the world &apos;s population has been the stories .
and they did this with so-called lead-landkarten .
where the language of the language was rang by untergeordnetem .
we &apos;ve moved in this so-called called vogt-zeitalter .
another example is that so-called virtual reality .
anyway , they &apos;re doing that .
and that &apos;s what we can look at now .
we understood that the weather is global .
so how do we work when we get there ?
information is a difference that makes a difference .

the first two sentences that are logical accurate .
i can say the kanzlerin is a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you what &apos;s wrong .
so if klaus says there &apos;s no soul .
but it wasn &apos;t in the achtiziger years .
they have an renewables today of 15 percent .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go again again .
and then it looks like this .
our goal was just to say , okay .
this has no one in the world .
and then they did a whole bunch of simulations .
so , it &apos;s great , then we have an business model .
and that &apos;s like a little bit of the message .
and in the time they can respond to other people .
then we have to break our must-run capacity to the net .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .

and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize .
i grew up with a gehörigen portion of science fiction .

we &apos;re going to have a machine here .
but you know what they don &apos;t have right ?
they were just like people in this room .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
this is a idiotische debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .

this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
there is someone sitting in the back there who had no childhood .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make you crazy ?
let me show you that from the close point .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
now , the erlebende itself lives life continuously .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
that &apos;s not how it works at all .
the erlebende itself has no voice in this choice .
we think about our future as a vorausgesehene memories .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
there are other pleasure , but this is dominant .
well , your erlebendes itself isn &apos;t going to be happier .
the more money you deserve , the more you are happier .
this is a problem that many players have .
that constant feedback is not in real life .
we &apos;re developing ourselves to collaborative thinking , a lot of creatures .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
i &apos;m just going to ask you , that &apos;s logical .
what we want is to create the future .
so i say , let &apos;s start the weltverändernden .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open the doors ?
see , dr. kean has changed his mind .
again , what potential is we going to want to do abrufen ?
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .

bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
bonobos are with chimpanzees , our next living relatives .
we &apos;re learning trust and the rules of the game .

we produce androgen , and we &apos;re talking about androgene .
and that &apos;s not just related to gender .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
i &apos;m a jessi and this is my suitcase .

on the left , you see a little boat .
tempt was one of the leading members of the 1980s .
so they communicate -- they &apos;re walking along their fingers .
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
so they move around and they make kunstinstallationen like this .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
so there &apos;s all this rummel from the big unveiling .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingbroke .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
it was something that we knew .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and if it wasn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t stop .
here &apos;s a clip from this angriffs- code .
we &apos;re talking about 15,000 lines of code .
these results were achieved by several weeks of work .
the idea is to mimic a digital model .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is generisch .
you could also use ordinary wurm- technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
so the driving force behind it is the cyber- superpower .
i filmed in kriegsgebieten -- difficult and dangerous .
you know how many people are watching these tedtalks ?
it was &quot; in eternity forever . &quot;
what do you think the answer will be like ?
the answer is likely to be very likely .
no wanted to do something with the movie .
no , that was not the mistake at all .
and then we offer one of these great düfte .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
these are the people that shape my worldview .
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
and that &apos;s what these tags did .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
you can look around in all these museums here .
you get into two ways -- very simple .
i love this guy ; his expression is unbezahlbar .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best thing is , in a second .
but what if you want to see the pinselstriche ?
you put it in there . you can really go in .
this is sternennacht , probably never seen before .
and that was an experience in humility .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like that either .
in the summer 2009 , honduras under a major verfassungskrise .
he asked octavio to become a stabschef .
on this airport , a surface of 100 quadratkilometern .
the faces of the audience were very serious and notice .
a typical walmart provides 100,000 products today .
i think i may have heard more hands .
because the images made it feel real for them .
three things : tastemaker , teilnahmecommunities and unexpected .
this year , it was almost 200 million times .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
my grandmother never let me have his life forgotten .
i didn &apos;t know how to use it .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
is it about the details or the colors ?
so i think the basics are very simple .
and let me show you a simple example .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
we still know one , where all the gas workers are .
and we want to put this in a global scale .
he &apos;s typing &quot; beutelratte &quot; in the official database .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
because this is where the actual regierungsarbeit is happening .
we need to look at the machinery of the government .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
the transition is happening . we can feel it .
these little öltröpfchen were the primitivste zellenform zellenform .
and try and do it again with another generation .
and i get a character in the book .
fireflies in a glass , i found quite exciting .
and that holds the way through the rest of the book .
it also shows itself in other places of the book .
at one point , the screen is filling up with leaves .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
we just alberten around it as well .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in haftanstalten and prison .
in my opinion , the world &apos;s world is fundamentally changing .
in many areas people had had to be scared of lynchmobs .
so these women met , and they just talked about .
and i just walked over and i just listened .
wr people want to help people who have been innocent .
i learned very simple things in my work .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
and i have to say , there was power .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
what would you say to someone who believes ?
so the dramatic numbers come from the prisoners .
recession . gridlock . doomsday . egypt . syria .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
so the amygdala is our early warning , our gefahrendetektor .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleons soldiers got silber-besteck , napoleon himself .
it &apos;s new nanotechnologien on the way , nano-materialien .
this is technologieunterstützte innovation that exists today .
what are they going to consume ? what will they want to do ?
i studied ms. printers and she was in atemnot .
i hired them and made me care .
i remember it was yesterday .
both of my cases of mine , fraßen me .
some of my favorites happened in the last five years .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny little idea .
you know , he was 1835 here .
he described one of them as a very &quot; usually . &quot;
now , he &apos;s on the red list .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not being seen as a great loss .
the question is , why people accept this .
this is wladimir tsastsin from tartu in estonia .
somebody was hacked and hacked the system .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of diginotar .
it &apos;s called the automatically verbindende stone .
a couple of years ago , i started to design myself .
let me show you how they work .
and we want to make this material available for all available .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
and the key implication of this is extinction .
but the waorani didn &apos;t kill the speer with the spear .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all mineralvorkommen .
this is a whole book , an example of nichtbild-daten .
and if possible , i will find some of the strange ones .
and she does this because of the content in the pictures .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
and we &apos;re so neu as much as we want .
and the world we lived in was like this .
do you want the buttons or reißverschluss ? stone or acid ?
it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and fascination .
and everyone knew that it worked like this , right ?
in fact , it can feel really paranormal .
she would say it was like a donnernder train .
he finished all the following and did something completely new .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t have any longer human .
and the suggestion was to build a lot of other kohlefabriken .
this is in our entire country of zweitgrösste americas .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
if we übertreiben it , we can zurückschütten a little bit .
here &apos;s another couple of people who are testing it .
this is actually not supposed to be a joke at all .
yeah , what do we do now ?
i think so six dollars , or something like that .
so , i think it &apos;s a very gelungener hack .
and this is the kernanliegen of the biohackern .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
how many doors did the house , where they live ?
the only thing they had was their head .
and life was living in the küstenregion of british columbia .
that means you &apos;re talking about sounds and rhythm .
we &apos;ve been used to that things happen linear .
the whole thing is , i have to say that .
i apologize that i have to abkürzen so much .
i &apos;m also going to evaporate what &apos;s inside .
just like it used to be on the village before .
and what does it actually look like ?
there &apos;s going to be more to my glasses .
i don &apos;t know who you know about this picture .
that &apos;s the time period where you fall in love .
so , like a human being , a certain kind of things .
we could only slide as amorphe mollusken through the weltmeere .
if we &apos;re in fact , we don &apos;t get phosphorus .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
that means the ants weigh a lot more than us .
there are still six and a half billion billion billion trees .
because the frankfurter facility could be best the phosphorus back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
we &apos;ve been using it for three years now .
and the oil we can replace is through other energy .
no , throw it away , right ? right ?
they can wegschmeißen where they go and they stand .
in the countries where people get to money .
i can &apos;t play this way in 20 years .
because the notes are the only link directly to him .
and loud , f and b , etc . , etc .
this is the hammerköpfe in the piano of my fingers .
the dauernde berieselung now is not förderlich .
so i ask myself , how fachlich competent was this diagnosis ?
whether music makes you too sweet or too sweet .
so that was the first beginning of a personal musical expression .
and at all , you work a lot less than i do .
why do i have to afford to do the same little car ?
and then i immediately fall to one that is unfair .
spanish painter pablo once has a woman portraitiert .
and she asked him what are your hobbies ?
do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
actually , we know that something else is the case .
the soul is kind of intellectual says about leibniz .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
because in fact , this person isn &apos;t interested in evidence .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have any more ?
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
and then we started to negotiate with the insulanern .
have investors negotiate with investors , and i &apos;ve been looking for new gesellschafter .
we can also zweihundert kilowatt kilowatt on the net .
so , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies now .
this first one , that was more like a passionate thing .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
and this futterverwertung from 2.5 to one , he said .
&quot; 2.5 to one thing ? what does it feed ? &quot;
i first ate him in a restaurant in südspanien .
a journalistin journalist has been talking for a long time about this fish .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
i mean , they &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
i wasn &apos;t there for a long time at all .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely selbsterneuernd .
so the translation of the gut , the better the system . &quot;
he said , &quot; the skin functions like a sponge .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
because if the water is herausfließt , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
but for many people , it &apos;s too radical .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
so i &apos;m going to step back and erweitere the perspective .
you do something that is actually a little bit different .
i &apos;ll just show the top 500 of the populärsten wikipediaseiten .
and that &apos;s really good at the side of the science-fiction-rolle .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s coming out ? &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t have any self .
probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
the second factor is the services we use .
i &apos;ve left out of tides , geothermal , fusion and biofuels .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
there are some innovations in nuklearbereich ; modular , liquid .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
a very close wish for us to invent this technology .
where is the greatest interest , really , really ?
this is a variant of one thing that was made .
those who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
spezialisierte and prozessfähigkeiten and their combination lead to success .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and i took a while to find out .
these were umsichtige people , gebildete people , decent people .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths through measles , 20 per hour .
he befreite us from one of the worst geißeln of humanity .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
they verdunkeln their urine . they &apos;re almost never .
so we run away , and where do we walk ?
there were no weihnachtsbäume . we did all this .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
fracking is something that a half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do .
i &apos;m going to explain it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain to you why i explain it .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my head .
many of you probably know about this trick in the room .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo-effekt ?
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
this is my flesh , and i can do that .
the first one of these falls is to admit complexity .
what it ruins was the memories of the experience .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
it has moments of erlebens , one after another .
most of them are completely ignored by the erinnernden self .
the biggest difference between them is to deal with time .
i mean , how much do we know about our memories ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
that &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
we currently spend three billion hours a week with online-spielen .
ok , imagine this as extreme selbstmotivierung .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
and that &apos;s an economist . so it makes sense .
and these were sort of the first of the people that were developed .
so , i think , we &apos;re going to play a game today .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re on .
this supercomputer is called the global aussterbungs- , of course .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use a synonym-wörterbuch back then .
they teach them to open doors .
and it was also after the three months .
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
is it for other geltend or is it for us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
our gut is a wonderful gastfreundlichen environment for these bacteria .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
now , imagine two other little changes .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known among primates .
in most of my activities , i have two hüte .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are giving off in the fötalen stage testosterone .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as girls .
in our observation , we &apos;ve got into all kinds of unbequemen areas .
we see this in all sorts of different areas of human life .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a bildpunkt , flying bildpunkt .
this would be called , in ingenieurteams , a echtzeit-kontrollsystem .
here are the results we &apos;ve just got .
but this is a lot of unnützer transporte and more complicated things .
does anybody see the movie &apos; butterfly and taucherglocke ?
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
since that time , we have all sorts of recognition .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i said , &quot; please in the air . &quot;
and i feiere , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world , all of it made sense to me .
we don &apos;t want iran to make the bomb .
i want to tell you how we found that .
these zentrifugen in iran are divided up in 15 calls .
and guess what we found in the angriffscode ?
of course , this cannot be done by a human being .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to ask .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i don &apos;t know how empfänglich people will be .
how much money is needed to do that ?
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
i really like your way sergey brin . now .
so , how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
are you ? you can see a little bit nervous .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
what about me ? what about the druchschittstypen ?
this is my brand in my little , verzerrten industry .
what &apos;s next is the next thing you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
a little more about them , which is not them .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with this .
a achtsame , verspielte brand . how is your brand ?
and how was that for you ? what it &apos;s successful ?
this is just online -- no press , no television .
it doesn &apos;t even exist online . no streaming .
and ultimately , we should be welcome to fear .
click , and wumms , is in this museum .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called the collections .
this is the gesandten , the nationalgallerie .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
look , let me give you an analogy .
so quantum mechanics says that unbewegliche objects are just as comfortable .
we found that it &apos;s really weird .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what &apos;s really awesome .
there &apos;s more . it &apos;s even deeper .
now , we are far away from this goal .
all the parties , all the fraktionen of society , they supported this .
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
it was a store that was draeger .
this is a deal like a vergnügungspark .
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing regalfläche .
well , let me show you a little bit more about this .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
autofarben , außenfarbe of the car -- i have 56 opportunities .
and this video was actually sent to the january .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endlosschleife .
and all of this leads to a big question .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was completely left that she could fail .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i met the decision to go to the u.s.
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
but you can combine something special like this .
for example , the fish was recorded on a anglerausflug .
this is my wlan-waage . a very simple thing .
and over 10,000 aeds have been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
but she does something that no other business does .
so he got the citizen to check them .
and it &apos;s reibungslos , organic , of course .
but what happens to &quot; citizens connect &quot; is different .
it turned out on the side . went home .
this is great . this is the digital process .
let &apos;s call it a lot of money , it costs a lot of money .
so , if you can turn the light back .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a mehrzellige community .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
so today , evolution can happen over the time of microseconds .
so in other words , i first define what i want .
so find programs which are most likely to set numbers .
finally , i get some programs that can make numbers perfect .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities .
the child in me is really excited about these possibilities .
you can say things in the world .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
she was also the beginning of many of our lives in our family .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
i remember this as if it was yesterday .
i tried to say something about our justizsystem .
the united states today has the highest inhaftierungsrate of the world .
i &apos;ve kept some talks in germany about the death penalty .
he said , &quot; there &apos;s no death penalty .
and i said , &quot; yeah , very happy . &quot;
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to work against injustice .
we want to eliminate lebenslängliche haftstrafen without bedingte for children .
even who kills somebody is not just a killer .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story .
i had a 14jährigen , poor black boy as clients .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
we have hinreißen hinreißen from the rhetoric of punishment .
and i think that our current current doesn &apos;t help anybody .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
i love this one , &quot; watson bezwingt human enemy . &quot;
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
it &apos;s about making it for a range of goods .
and then let us project this analogy in the future .
16 terawatt energy prasseln all 88 minutes on the earth &apos;s surface .
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
there &apos;s a program that maybe some might know .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and the whole time i got more and more knowledge .
and when i zuhörte her , she made keuchende sounds .
i went home to my way home .
if you don &apos;t do anything , you can never make anything again .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
i &apos;ve been able to miss two times a blinddarmentzündung .
in both cases , operierte and it was fine .
in this state , about 24,000 centuries of umgänglichen errors die .
and at the end , you just want to get the erbärmlichen remains .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
and the motives of online-kriminellen are very easy to understand .
in the future , most crimes will play online .
there are ourselves in front of us like diginotar .
now , how do people die in such remote dimensions ?
but if you &apos;re in a foreign republic , you can do it .
betonbausteine became very quickly the meistgenutzte baueinheit in the world .
essentially , in the process of our time , has become the betonbaustein .
littlebits are electronic modules that have specific function .
but wait , this is really my lieblings-projekt .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex kind of metaphysical worldview .
christianity , islam , buddhism , judaismus or whatever .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a e-buch .
there &apos;s a series of photographs somewhere here -- they &apos;re here .
they get a model that comes from all over the earth .
a consequence of it was that the telephone was never broken .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not them . &quot;
why do they abuse us when we can &apos;t buy ?
and the world we live in now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
this struck me when i wanted to replace my jeans .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
a chromosome is just a piece of inertes chemical material .
that &apos;s the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
there are enzymes that are called the restriktionsenzyme that actually digest dna .
it verfärbte blue because of the genes we added .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
these wires are leiten ampere when the machine runs on hochleistung .
and i &apos;m not expecting that to change .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your work .
i would rather keep doing this work that i love .
this quest me to the old greece and the old rome .
the greeks called these göttlichen diener-geister of creativity „ dämonen .
if your work floppte -- not fully your mistakes , right ?
it &apos;s like asking someone to eat the sun .
but even i have this thing in my maultierart , sometimes this thing .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it . “ .
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
i started thinking , i should just einstampfen the project .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
when we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here to here .
in the andes , this glacier is the trinkwasserquelle for this city .
but if you &apos;re versiegen , most of the drinking water will be wegfallen .
so the alliance for climate change has launched two campaigns .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it also smells good .
versorge america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
so if i put them side-by-side , that &apos;s what you &apos;re interested in .
most people know that most people are familiar with this .
and then i took a sahnespender , and that &apos;s connected to it .
so i know some who haven &apos;t registered .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
and the third area that actually explains itself .
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god to virtualisieren a piece of verlernt .
and other examples are the ambienten , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
which of course , of course , of course , is extremely entgegenkommt and it &apos;s a computer game .
but i &apos;m just going to make it a little bit curious .
and of course , as it takes influence to perception .
gestaltgesetz of the continuity , gestaltgesetz of the continuity and so on .
and that &apos;s then , again , that &apos;s coming back .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described .
and this is the projection of this vision , rückkopplung , seeing .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
this is the time of most perceptions that we have .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i want to introduce you to a particular aspect of curiosity .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the delicacy will get bigger .
this is what it says , the more you are , the better you are .
do you have heard about the trees of trees ?
you can only have nullemissionen if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot , you would have emissions .
because it &apos;s unfreundlich to go and take the nutrients .
that &apos;s natural , of course , but the pharmaceutical facilities are themselves .
these are sechsundzwanzig countries that control 40 percent of the population .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you put the wrong things together , you have a müllproblem .
if you walk , yes , everyone destroys the ground .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
because we don &apos;t make the things more free .
when i was a interpretin , i first got the geschriebenen notes .
the notierten notes have the function of the letters of one textbook .
the work of the interpreten starts similar to the kind of a theaterregisseurs .
i play erklärend what these sounds have to mean .
i &apos;m going to take the audience &apos;s breath , consciously or unconsciously .
then the same thing happens in a good , angeregten conversation .
i &apos;ll never play anything like that moment .
i wonder that you often forget something quite elementares .
no longer needed to whistle a liedchen or sing .
or b , because you didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so please listen , if a music is played .
there was no piano at all as an instrument .
and also , what you would think of in the mind today .
that &apos;s the first year of his value .
and then rocks auftürmt , so he &apos;ll give you the picture .
from that time , an anecdote that you may be familiar with .
the person is supposed to have a common ancestor or a common ancestor .
you feel that it &apos;s the actual truth behind .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled them .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum , lots of ideas .
the united states at the time , the jülich was called kfa .
because a good engineer has built either fantastic cars or atomkraftanlagen .
it &apos;s mostly coming from asia , in the case of japan .
and we can rein-rausschalten with this big battery two milliseconds .
and then you see , there &apos;s already a huge amount of dna there .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
so you could feel like to sell him .
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he will act .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love story .
they grew up fleischrinder on what basically the wetlands were .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
depending on a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensiv , not intense .
we &apos;re not realisten , we genießer . we &apos;re &#91; unclear &#93; .
this is the one on two billion years of arbeitserfahrung zurückgreift .
because they are the ones who are experts too .
and i immediately see a different pattern that does it .
you can test it for my talk in the classroom .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
so , i can zoom in in a particular frame of time .
but secretly , i was really longing to the real train of titanic .
this is the truth . the studio did not know that .
that wasn &apos;t a movie , no hd , that was real .
well , they were also hochtechnisch and bedurften more sophisticated planning .
so that got me right , and i wanted more .
and that set was a very accurate copy of the ship .
it changed my way to make films completely .
you need to be ready to take risks like this .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
it &apos;s renewables , as they often call .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the target ?
the uranium gets used gradually , a little bit like a candle .
a nuklearreaktor , which offers a solution to the waste .
the fact is that that uncertainty should be worried about us .
and that &apos;s a train i think is appropriate .
they spend a lot of their time increasing structures .
konstrukteure recognize this kind of collaboration as a core nucleus .
ceos are something about average , but here it gets interesting .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
so from the same , bad team of one among the best .
so there should be a better nine at the beginning of my todeszahl .
and soon , i was writing an article about gentechnisch food .
ask questions , ask evidence , demand evidence .
lots of studies were done to see if this was true .
lots of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious thing .
has a single one in the audience who will ever die of measles ?
no fear , no qualen , puff , superhero , disappeared .
he has just evolved with a few other people .
what about kinderlähmung ? let &apos;s do that . why not ?
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mies .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
there &apos;s no description of what &apos;s happening here .
we can do this time machine on everything we want .
and when i get around , the fingers changes his position .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
that trick your friends and neighbors . thank you .
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
i hope you &apos;re looking at it . thank you very much .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest among researchers .
and my talk today is mostly going to be about these cognitive ones .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
these are real patients who put on a painful procedure .
from the point of view itself , b clearly had an worse time .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
so , you can ask : how happy is the erlebende self ?
we know something about what happiness is doing .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we were looking at how feelings with income .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
my inspiration comes from one event , which is 2,500 years old .
there are these ancient cubes , schafsknöcheln . you know ?
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
i want to say we &apos;re ready for our own episches game .
and i can tell you , it was a transformation .
and i tend to see widrigkeiten as my shadow .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
or do you want to be stronger , stronger , more force .
are we in a kind of evolutionäres balance in a species ?
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hotelzimmertür .
can you imagine a good thing that comes out of tobacco ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
if you have something to give you , you &apos;ll give it now .
and no , it &apos;s not burning , or san francisco .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the urwald of congo .
just if it doesn &apos;t seem appropriate , maybe it &apos;s a game game .
under a hat , i &apos;m dealing with the story of anatomy .
and as a general term , we can use the word intersexualität .
and the nebennieren places that are virilisierende hormones , which are virilisierende hormones .
if you didn &apos;t move away , you have buried them .
we find other merkwürdigkeiten in terms of what their rights are .
but a lot of people caught up in a very strange position .
now , in practice , people are not tested to their chromosome .
i mean , what are somebody doing with so many outfits ?
i brought seven pair of underpants , and that &apos;s all .
and i just want to show you my favorite work for this week .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
if we have cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
you see , in the middle , the kolosseum , the fluß tiber .
well , today we know everything about where our things come from .
but we just know very little about where things go .
they cause what they &apos;re doing with bildpunkten water .
but actually , it was a greater fun night .
imagine that these bildpunkte could really start flying .
this is what we want to use as a potential impulse for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
they &apos;re interacting in certain ways with their surroundings and their experiences .
and as a iceberg melts , i think it &apos;s a vorzeitliche atmosphere .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty abgefahren .
you go to the block and it was a revelation .
the revelation is , death is part of the life .
i was the only one who could talk to the flugbegleitern .
but in my humanity , i have given my ego to my ego .
i didn &apos;t deal with two years more with my wife .
i just wish i could grow up my children .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
the idea behind the stuxnet computer-wurm is pretty simple .
so we should find better soon what the goal is .
they knew all kinds of bits and bytes that they had to attack .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
and neither the maschinenführer , the sicherheitssystem , will notice it .
he doesn &apos;t have anything to do with zentrifugen , with urananreicherung .
they are in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the zielreichsten environments .
now this brand , the qualcomm stadium , the staples center ...
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of statten .
there are some places that we can turn to .
but what this picture is , which is a problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening a whole lot of transparency right now .
and the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever . &quot;
&apos; 80s , it meets skaterpunk , except at the waschtag .
and so i found a company called sarajevo zaltman in pittsburg .
why is it important , neuzustarten ? what is the red ?
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to do .
we went to sao paulo where we were banned außenwerbung .
now , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
they &apos;re welcome to fear . they welcome the risk .
open the map , and jump with a click .
they are , they want to go to the end of the gang .
in the previous example , it was about finding details .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
for example , that would be someone who is completely logical .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
i don &apos;t see why that should not be that .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle .
that &apos;s the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
you could try to expand the capacity of the existing apartments .
of course , each one of these themes was made out of many , many smaller decisions .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
we put a little verkostungsecke right on the nest &apos;s entrance .
every single harvard employees is automatically going automatically to be part of a lebenszeitfond .
we can do better with more categories than more choices .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
now there are 10,000 parodien from &quot; friday &quot; in youtube .
cats look at cats who look at this video .

three months later , i moved and the adventure continued .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
photos like this : a construction site along a lot of the road .

the beschaffung of software takes a few years .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is in change .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if a neighbor helps the other , we empower our communities .
a government is absolutely essential , but it needs to be more efficient .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
what is this new state that &apos;s going to take off the world ?
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
it &apos;s quite an amazing invention when you think about it .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
we see the process feeding from itself .
but i really believe that after we do .
i just go to khoya , an interactive expert app app .

and of course , it can &apos;t be there in germany . &quot;
vaclav havel , the great tschechische politicians , once said .
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be tapferer .
because ultimately , our humanity depends upon our humanity .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
if somebody lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so painful .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud . &quot;
and more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
from my augenwinkel , i saw the janitors .
that our survival of survival is connected to every single person .
and yet , at the end of all the ages , they don &apos;t end up with a verhaftung .

and i was good , i swam with cum laude .
i sent them home without talking to my oberarzt .

i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not doing things always .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
the first story is by charles darwin , one of my heroes .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .

and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .

you see in the upper field that its chromosome just falls apart .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
last year , last year , the machine for the first time .
it means that we reached a cultural impact next to science .

with your chemiker-blockade , john -- how do you do that ?
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
so , the people in the west really thought about creativity for a long time .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .

and i guess that many of you have done that too .
so , i &apos;m looking at this as could i just write a song ?

but then sukzessive the script , as a primärmedium , was hit .
and these two worlds just pop together , new and old thinking .
but no longer on the local level , but on global level .
but also our perception itself , as it makes us , too .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is this vision .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphor-problem .
so , for example , schütz the environment , driving less car .
so the question is , how do we deal with these windeln ?
here &apos;s one of the proof of that , by the way , that men are not pigs .
you can only be klimaneutral if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
and it &apos;s really first to ask what the right thing is .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
the things that are only used are going to be in technical systems .
and i &apos;m not sure that they really are dabeibleiben .
and so , in every store , you can zurückkriegen things .
so , we don &apos;t need to be klimaneutral , we can be klimapositiv .
you study the work that he created before and after .
how were his circumstances , like the society and the politics ?
he asked me what the preamble for me was .
when the correct thing happens , the student gets the nächstschwierige piece .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
and the tune out of the gesungenen and the rhythm from the dance .
this is a little bub that doesn &apos;t care about feuerlöschen .
this is now a dreisatz that describes a logic .
here you need some logic , but also lies the willingness to lie .
the first sentence is klaus , there &apos;s no soul .
and when i get right , the kanzlerin is a man .
if i didn &apos;t right , the kanzlerin is not a man .
second , if he &apos;s right , he &apos;s got no soul .
the buridansche esel is a esel that consists of pure nature .
because he doesn &apos;t know what haystack is supposed to do first .
i &apos;ve been working in the collective of 11 years , which was basisdemokratisch .
on this island , this is the island of graciosa on the azoren .
yeah , this is what it looks like at the bottom .
there will be a whole bunch of widerständen and arguments .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent &quot; he said .
no , not because i &apos;m a selbstgerechter genießer and gutmensch .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentiniern .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company has bought the land .
i asked him how to become such a fisch-experten .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t do your fish ? &quot;
it &apos;s the last abwehr , before something in the body .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
and who sees weiterforscht that this is particularly true of men .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
so i decided i was 15 when i was 15 .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
and i &apos;m going to fly with a little roboterfahrzeug through the ship .
we just play the cost of the cost . none of the spur .
our imagination is a force that can even create reality .
and the clarity of your team is more important than any of the world &apos;s lorbeer .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that make it down to zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
usually you &apos;re just going to be wrong , and some people don &apos;t come .
now , i wondered , how can i really get rid of this ?
now , where are we going to go , what is the right approach ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on that . hundreds of them .
if we go back from there , how should the 2020 testimony ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
usually , most people start to orient themselves to the task .
so i offered a $ 10000 dollar prize to the winner .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who interest it can go back .
smallpox . smallpox had killed billions of people on this planet .
i think that really , and no , that &apos;s not a wunschdenken .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
she wouldn &apos;t impfen her child against kinderlähmung . no case .
why ? because we don &apos;t have kinderlähmung , and you know what ?
echinacea , a little antioxidantium that helps you on your tracks .
well , i think i understand , we hate the drug industry .
please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
and then people could eat the food and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
a deception becomes something real , because somebody perceives it .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
but it turned out that it &apos;s not all .
this is my skin . this is not a spezialeffekt from hollywood .
i know what people think when they see this .
this is really my skin . this is not a spezialeffekt from hollywood .
we &apos;re still going to meet a couple of times in the next few days .
they were asked to report all the 60 seconds about their pain .
so what a story is about is umbrüche , significant moments of moments and ends .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
that will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
and i don &apos;t just mean less , even though that &apos;s part of it .
how can we transfer these feelings from play into reality ?
so the zusammenspielen is allowing rise to the pressures of ties , trust and with each other .
players love to be part of awe of awe of missionen missions .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
it &apos;s a online-spiel where you need to get through a ölknappheit .
and if you create it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
we degradieren a human who has value for our society .
ah , the majority . i like to , as a doctor .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
if we get vorausblicken , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
this is actually the true verschmelzung of human and machine .
there are 68 million people who are facing the wheelchair in the wheelchair .
he said , &quot; sanskrit , you have to go to the house .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
so here we see a young female and male in a verfolgungsspiel .
only that i think it might be rather , not true .
so sexspiele are spread , both bonobos and people .
in order to be successful in a more successful world , we need to play .
as a consequence , the body develops more than the typical female process .
when the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
okay , just a quick example of an alternative of intersexualität .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualismus .
and it makes me angespannt in terms of thinking about democracy .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s going on with the gründungsvätern .
and so they &apos;ve been able to get the future of the world civil rights movement .
so how do we operationalisieren the question of the characteristics of the character ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i got .
this is what we call our lab , wahrnehmbares design .
halbzeit , people make a short call , go on toilet .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
imagine that every single one of the people is being run .
it &apos;s a physikalisches form in london , but covered with bildpunkten .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
i &apos;m like , &quot; very archaisch , how can that be ? &quot;
now , each paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes alone or draw .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into tempts rooms .
we geneigt his bed so that he can see it outside .
it keeps us on the shelf and it makes us continue to develop .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s an amazing device .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one deserves to do it .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
and that urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
almost like that we were preparing for our lives .
i became a miracle of zuteil that day , not to die .
the gray boxes that you see here , these are echtzeit-kontrollsysteme .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
and in fact , this false eingehenden data is done by stuxnet before .
and if the worst conditions are , really bad things can happen .
and if you do that , eventually you get a cyber- massenvernichtungswaffe .
thank you for having a heidenangst eingejagt . thank you ralph .
but even apart , it &apos;s a very good piece of opportunity .
and the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever . &quot;
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
and just like that , all these companies disappeared , one after another .
so maybe you should be in front of the interview . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of grautöne and stuff .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was ausliefere .
and what was noticed was that i needed an expert .
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
what is the machete ? what puppenstadium are you at moment ?
that &apos;s actually just a period of time for two weeks .
one of the big stores full of it , we &apos;ll welcome the risk .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so , for example , this picture has about 10 billion bildpunkte , i think .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again in new york .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
this is where i expand it . we look at the center .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
i mean , this is just what my logical side is .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to keep out all of these extensions .
in the meantime , i was prepared to talk to tedglobal .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders .
and my friends from cairo asked me to say , thank you ted .
you know how many decisions do you make on a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
50 percent of their decisions were hit within nine minutes or less .
they tend to make worse decisions -- worse cash and worse choices .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; narrow . &quot;
okay . everybody is willing to take gary &apos;s supply .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; swing . &quot;
they have to make 62 different decisions to make the car completely .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
when i start with the simple start , i learn how i &apos;m going .
but at youtube , there are more than 48 hours of video video every minute .
rebecca blacks is one of the most popular videos of the year .
now we &apos;re not just comfortable with something , we do .
i knew she was coming to say goodbye .
&quot; because she &apos;s been holding them this morning , &quot; he said .
furthermore , tans mother is here in the fourth or fifth line .
make it impossible to say how the photograph was actually put together .
and yes , i have a job as you might recognize .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
and they realized that the city never frei this fire fire .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
this is not a political part of it , that &apos;s active .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
now , why are we drawing graphs in the technology on semi-logarithmischen curves ?
and each organism is using exactly the same letters and the same code .
so the neurons are the informationsverarbeitungsapparat , which built these zellengemeinschaften .
so the invention of language , for example , was a small step in this direction .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor does in the verbindungsmaschine .
now , all the übriggebliebenen , the numbers that have the number of sortiert .
it &apos;s with a method of rekombinierens , analog to reproduction . &quot;
because all these new technologies of today are feeding themselves .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the magischste thing for me .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history of children .
in another chapter you have to fotographieren a piece of baumrinde and tag .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re a little special . &quot;
it would be gewissenlos of us , consciously and specific people . &quot;
innovation , creativity , and development are not just coming from our heads .
i vertrete these kids who were convicted of very hard strafen .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the gerichtssaal ? &quot;
during the last three decades , the verbrechensrate in america is enormously down .
this is a fact that often put in a context of increase .
well , in fact , the number of gewaltverbrechen didn &apos;t change very much .
the foundation of a lot of these are technologies , and these are growing expotentiell .
this is the result of faster computers building quicker computers .
now scarcity is kontextbezogen , and technology is a resource force .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
it would be like a set of new , a new one never before .
how about beiträgen that we can &apos;t even predict ?
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
we &apos;re in the middle of the world and we &apos;re moving to the world cup .
that means that the player will beat safely three of them .
at that point , i was zugewiesen the kardiologischen layer in the kardiologischen service .
you say you &apos;ve never forgotten the names of the versterben .
i looked in the rachen and it was a little pink .
and i gave him an prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
&quot; do you remember the patient with the gereizten rachen ? &quot;
and the fish had also been lucky to be there .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
this shows the vast big role that can play a marine reserve .
and the farbtöne , you might remember , &quot; avatar . &quot;
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in a certain way .
and this is one of the three hauptquellen of these today .
mr. jain itself is on free feet , the aufenthaltsort is unknown .
diginotar is a vollmachtszertifikat from the netherlands -- or it was .
they sold this program for 280.000 euro to the egyptian government .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
but there &apos;s a hauptunterschied : the transistor was only for experts .
the idea behind littlebits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
lights , sound , solarelemente , motors -- everything should be available .
in 1957 , five missionare were trying to contact and made a mistake .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of forest that was amazing .
it &apos;s not going to make a distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
all cultures have involved in the dance with new lebenmöglichkeiten .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
this is a realistischerer case . this is a copy of the guardian .
and rick szeliski of microsoft &apos;s research was done , a very good collaboration .
but the spatial configuration of the images is actually significant .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , which was recorded right .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for themselves .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i don &apos;t have me niedergelassen .
these organisms can be completely immersed , they can actually live in the vacuum .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
they &apos;ve seen corn recently , which is just a bad experiment .
it &apos;s turning carbon dioxide into methane around under the use of hydrogen .
so the wires are very simple , and 13-tausend begegneten , suddenly , elektrischem resistance .
i find it better when we encourage our big creative to live .
i have to tell you , i think this was a big mistake .
be there for your contribution , whatever it is .
i believe in it and i feel that we should teach .
in a certain sense , the arctic eiskappe is the schlagende heart of our global klimasystems .
and one reason is , this vast heat heat corresponds to greenland from the north .
these austrocknung in the world leads to a dramatic increase on fire .
the united states is one of the biggest verschmutzer , together with china .
it &apos;s affordable and liebenswert , and workers stay in adulthood and bread .
in the coalergy , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
versorge america with 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years .
you connect it to a particular note , and then it tends to vote .
this actually took off eight really eight really , really , that these networks .
so the device you see there , that doesn &apos;t work .
the interesting thing about this is when i &apos;m going to make a little trip .
we &apos;re still verhaftet as a informationsvermittlung , very strong .
and that &apos;s what i had last half the year .
so i &apos;ve been busy to talk when , of course , or intuitively .
the next generation of graphischen benutzungsoberflächen has been working very much more with behavior .
and the most important thing is to look at the soil as first .
we could reduce that for 10 percent , but what does that do ?
because the phosphorus will be emitted by the pigs on the festen .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is ölverbrauch .
we &apos;re doing in brazil from where we get rid of nutrients .
in the way , we can get nutrients in the way that we have in agriculture .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people , rather badly .
a woman in germany eats about six roles three kilograms of their lives .
that &apos;s why they help , ask them to ask people .
now there are lots of people working there , and they can all be engaged .
there are extra and a half of a company , where everybody can join .
the composer is getting more and more to the friend you &apos;re living with .
now , how do you begin to speak the language of music ?
you learn to find the notes on the instrument on the instrument .
now why am i asking for my audience to listen to it as well ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
a artwork that you never look at has no force to work .
so they &apos;re going to be hörbar what they &apos;ve only embraced in the mind .
i say , ulf , what are you going to need in the n ?
and as i say the word justice , it &apos;s a uncomfortable feeling away .
they can also try that with words like revenge or gewinnsucht or diagnoses .
one day , this mirror says yes , there &apos;s a schönere .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s wife of worchester .
she likes him especially because he has a tendency to aufrichtigkeit .
and he says , &quot; well , i &apos;m at the fire fire . &quot;
although i &apos;m at fire , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
i want to share with you what we found in my institute .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not coming back from stop , physical nature .
so lying to lie that you can just use this logic logic .
but the key is , if i have right , it &apos;s true .
and now our täuschendes consciousness , that you can do something .
this has to do with that we go back into the 21st century .
if you get more windkraft each other , the system begins to fail .
they &apos;re always running three of the dieseln , two will always wait .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green one is our system .
if you do that somewhere , it takes a long time .

&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fischeiern to the birds .
oh , and by the way , these flamingos are not even there .
it has evolved throughout evolution to aufzusaugen aufzusaugen . &quot;
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical sterbediagramm after age .
and from here , i can go into the site and put them back again .
and we did that , and then we managed for a while .
this is immensely important . it &apos;s a good job for marketing . &quot;
and i noticed how much these tiefseetauchgänge , a weltraummission similar .
but i didn &apos;t understand much about leadership before i do this expeditionen .
no fame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
and we became a richtigen for a period of four and a half years .
nasa has such a lieblingssatz : &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
no big endeavor , the innovation has been ruled by the risk .
co2 corresponds to the planet and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
it turns out that if you can get it to zero .
because although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
you &apos;re going to say , you know , they &apos;re nuts ! that &apos;s good .
but as they &apos;ve talked to different people in the world about these possibilities .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little people get supported .
so , if you want to do a exekutive , you &apos;re going to get significant better .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high rates have a strong effect ?
so the question is : can we do that ? i think it &apos;s .
and we &apos;re talking about ironisch , with little quotes , &quot; progress . &quot;
and you can do that because you don &apos;t connect cause and connection .
we love to hüllen in lies . we love that .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
it &apos;s not about genes herumzuschieben . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
and that , even though none of them -- it &apos;s just zuckerpillen .
if you take capsules , it &apos;s even more effective than any form of pills .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
or &quot; how was your journey after albania ? &quot; or something like that .
and they &apos;re going to say , &quot; who &apos;s suffered from both ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the erinnrung .
and end , very , very important , and in this case , the end is the end .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
well , these are three weeks , and these are just a single one hours .
well , the two ways of self throw two terms of happiness .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is quite a complicated process .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
this is a player who &apos;s on the verge of something called epischen sieges .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons .
here are the four things that i found . first of all .
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little überschwänglich .
we put games in order to overcome the suffering of the real world .
they were playing a würfelspiel , and they were able to get to a epischen adventure .
they were würfelspiele for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute for the future .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me and play with me .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
and the one student will get harder geprüft , get the better teachers and so forth .
in fact , in this study , the teachers were not eingeweiht .
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
a few . probably so many of them are creative people here .
evolution priviligiert the creatures that adapt to their environment .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a verlockende , fascinating and scary possibility .
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it to make these changes in your genes ?
the human genome project project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , the number of them .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of überbetont in the narrative of human evolution .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction are also survival of the bonobos .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their lives long .
first of all , a ballspiel on bonobo-art -- and i don &apos;t think of fussball .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s not this test .
we have two creatures , both in the middle 1979 , right now .
i get all my clothes out of my second hand , and in second-hand-shops .
what &apos;s interesting today is the echtzeit-kontrollsysteme of our lives in our lives .
well , this night , everybody went to dinner .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw on every day is still there .
and we got the commission to design the expo in the expo .
you see the person wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
on the left-hand side , you see the bildpunkte , the different eingefangenen sensations .
and just like that , you show the iceberg another side of his personality .
my life is really quite blessed by work on some amazing projects .
so we have created a device that &apos;s completely free from constraints .
we set up a projektor line against a wall of the hospital .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you about today .
i &apos;m glad we &apos;ve never met each other as adults .
she saved my life , and my partner and i rescued her .
and that gave us great confidence for that , which we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s not easy .
and often we ran into a dead and we had to collect ourselves .
so the idea here is not just the maschinenbediener in the control room .
we need to make the consequences , and we &apos;re going to start doing better .
so despite that warning , i knew that anyone would buy the namensrechte .
these people are connected to the film in eternity forever .
so , sir , you can help me ? i need help .
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you a ausfühliche version .
what connection is that to the thought and feelings about them ?
are you something that a little ruhiger , reservierter , conservative ?
are they established , traditionally , pflegend , beschützend , compassionate like oprah ?
big data is transformed for organizations around the world in great opportunities .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or something .
but at the same time , we need a good fraction of intuition to actually restore experiments .
i remember playing a child playing on a bodenschwelle .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
they just share the building from homes against cities .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december in december of a k in miami .
the other place , which was very interested in the urbanism , is singapore .
a million people are leaving latin america a year and traveling in the united states .
how good do you think they &apos;re the decisions ?
and we found that there was actually a correlation .
you know , the average supermakrt today gives you 45,000 products .
every single one of you could be about the internet until next saturday .
because you do this , if you &apos;re going to be yosemite mountain bear .
if you want to know , these other tips are also freitage .
a schuluniform to the knöcheln , because she had to get six years .
before i get rid of the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
i looked through the duschtrennwand and she looked at the other side .
and in order to midnight , the monk and said he had to close the coffin .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , before leichtigkeit .
so the first rule is that combined images should have the same perspective .
maybe you know , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 follower on twitter .
and you can do that through these sorts of ways , but also through crowdsourcing .
we know exactly where all atms are around maastricht around .
so , what did we do ? we &apos;ve done it in the netherlands .
how did he get searching for this particular kind of help ?
they were there in february , and it has last february of the last february .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and not even like a technik-unternehmen , but rather like the internet itself .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
you usually come out when you put in your town in your town .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
this is a slide that i happen to take from my folder .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to a power in the leistungsskala .
and this is what i want to look at on the zeitskala of life .
this is the reason why the consistency grows to antibiotics .
we have a lot of cells that are not on themselves .

if you break the goldfischglas , it &apos;s all possible , it cuts happiness .
does it allow the chemistry to make these really large molecules that hasn &apos;t been done before ?
it actually took a couple of years starting with a bioethischen review before we did the first experiments .
the viral particles were then opened up by the cells and came back and killing e. coli .
i talked recently about the oil industry , and they said that they were doing this model right now .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the lichtmikroskop .
the elektronikindustrie had a dozen components and look at the diversity of that .
but the same thing we &apos;re doing right now is to use the same approaches to the development of vaccines .

it &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how it evolves .
and finally , i can ausblenden the entire sequence by running the lautstärke-siftable to the left .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of the matter .
but always , always always , always the idea that it &apos;s going to be simple and accessible .
and what are our values and what are our goals , our foundation ?
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
they have no lead-landkarten , but they &apos;ve been using the songlines , or traumpfade .

and what happens is the maschinenzeitalter , and it &apos;s happening the book , and it &apos;s the fotolitografie .
it sounds very spacig , and sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
you can explain that much better , because there &apos;s a lot more than that .
many people use the word , but they don &apos;t even know what it means .
it &apos;s important for the variation in the first semester , the most amazing gestaltgesetze .

and it contains seeds of rare plants , so that they &apos;re going to contribute to the biodiversity .
a television , or a washing machine , that they &apos;re just using , they don &apos;t use .
i already said , you need about it as long as for the spoken language .
well , you can see , in all cases , nobody has to be a aussichtsloser candidate candidate .
or what i &apos;m going to do today is because what you might have thought about .
why don &apos;t we need to know that people know about something when it &apos;s true ?
but we know , if we say that , we are very sensitive to social settings .
it &apos;s impossible to do these things in a society that should work .
so we should be able to perceive them as something that is necessarily going to be present for our lives .
so the second sentence is , when klaus is right , he &apos;s got no soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , who &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here i brought to you a project that i want to introduce you to now .
you can only , of course , only if you managed to be managed in some kind of way .

well last year , 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
he said , &quot; no . they make it because the food is better . &quot;
now , i want to make this idea a little bit about what a little bit crazy .
so the summary contains a brief and a symbol of the field that comes from it .
and , instead of just moving in information , we can get it from that .
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , even more .
so i changed that and i did this other film about the great ship , falling away .
and the preparation of preparation were enormous . we had to build cameras and light and everything .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do here ?
i &apos;ve asked the top-wissenschaftler times , &quot; do we really have to go down close to zero ?
it &apos;s all about food that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a certain date .
but in this case , we have to get vollgas and get a miracle in very short time .
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that entfacht the idea of people here ?
i decided that this would be sent by fireflies &apos;s contribution to the environment here .
now , there are all kinds of spielereilösungen like this , but they &apos;re not getting much .
let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels , burning of either coal or natural gas .
one of them is the energy savings that makes these technologies dramatically lower than the kraftwerken .
instead of breaking that head down , they just burn it . a great thing .
if countries hit in places like koppenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
klimaskeptiker : do you have one or two sentences for you to convince you ?

if anybody had a 2,5cm high construction , he would have carried the price home .
and the basale lesson , i think , is actually a verbindender sport .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a neurologist .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
i think we can power the world with energy that they don &apos;t have at the same time .
it doesn &apos;t happen at all in this country at all , but 160.000 time in the world .
it &apos;s absolutely unexpected , and it &apos;s seelentötend itself to us that can afford .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this verrottete stuff , like penicillin .
but this is actually not what it &apos;s about . and then i open my hand .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing .
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen that right . &quot;
and then he added , really , really emotional , that has ruined the whole experience .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one in a self .
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life &apos;s lives ?
just to give you an idea of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;

why is it impossible in games to think , you can &apos;t just do everything ?
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .

this question was so sensitive that we decided to explore the answer and siftables .
and then even more active effects like speed and volume that you use on the entire sequence .
and now i combine the filter with the drums , so i can drive the effect live .
and you have to do it and understand it and understand it and understand .
these are the people who have at least officially registered on the website , d.i.y.bio-dot-org website .
that &apos;s what i believe is that there are fewer people registered than actually .
and hackerspaces , the computerhackerspaces , because the c-base in berlin was the first , neunzehnhundertfünfundneunzig .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it , and even to try and do whatever .
the interesting thing about this is that at the same time , at the same time , the human being was medienproduzent and medium .
all of that needs the ability to accept our basic ability , virtuality as a real habitat .
because steve jobs once said , you know , you need deeper to understand how .
this is what they call gestaltgesetz , or eben , which also affects us in perception .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think , we see from the front to the back .
you &apos;ll never forget it anymore because i show you where the dalmatiner is .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to go forward to see that i see the dalmatiner .

in the last 20 years , fünfzehntausend tons of spiders have been distributed to our fields in germany .

and they are designed by design that can just drive a farmer .
the dutch government explained , you &apos;ll be the world &apos;s first country , which is phosphorus .
in holland , of course , it &apos;s easier to understand , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
so , it &apos;s about creating a large footprint that becomes a feuchtgebiet .
so no longer save , rid of , prevent , reduce , no schuldmanagement , but intelligent waste .
so for the learning process of music , you need to take at least as long as the spoken language of speech .
now for me and for the composers , and what they might mean for him now .
now , i &apos;ve also been older as the chopin with zweiunddreißig , when he wrote the piece .
but what i &apos;d like to do is , because music is a beautiful , kommunikative thing .
i say , but surely you can tell , you know , they like it or not .
and the child is playing after a gedenkpause , rather than a red flower now .
from beethoven , you know , he knows more than he was deaf .
in such a lie , you see that the liar itself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
here &apos;s it , which is what we understand under politically correctness , again .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent people &apos;s minds .
so , you have to think about another philosophisches subject , a dauerbrenner from philosophy , present .
and if you place exactly the right thing in the middle room between two gleichgroßen , he &apos;s verhungert .
because he has led them to a fährte that he doesn &apos;t fit himself in .

he talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how somebody wanted to poison .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you do what &apos;s sustainable about eating chicken ? &quot;

they breed in a stadt kilometer , where the bodenbeschaffenheit is better for the nestbau .
this was the cause . it was the rechtfertigung . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m ever going to be .
in my high school , i went to school to school every day , every day .
in the matheunterricht , i was always caught by the teacher as i was , in the middle textbook , hidden .
i made my tauchschein in a pool of ymca in buffalo in buffalo , new york .
until today , i feel the deepest awe of what i see on my dives .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law &apos;s law &apos;s law , bekanntlich technology and magic .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must be involved in the filmkunst . &quot;
and then we started , we showed up , &quot; bismarck , &quot; and they were exploring with roboterfahrzeugen .
but at the end , it was out there that i was going to weltraumwissenschaftler with us in the deep sea .
i remembered last year when i got mosquitos and somehow liked the people .
these are energiefarmen , you &apos;re talking about many quadratkilometern , a thousand thousand times more area than a normal power station .
i think there are many , in the ted group there already .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is a nuclear approach .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is sort of the deadline , which has demonstrated us that we need to go around .
it would have been without the umweltherausforderung , but the power is more important .
then you invest a little bit in planning and organization . you draw and put spaghetti .
what you might be asking is : how does this happen ? what about those ?
and not only that , we have used our imagination to trash this world .
okay , there &apos;s reason , and i think we know what the reasons are .
you take them on , take the diseases back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening right now .
hundreds of thousands of unnötiger deaths in a country that will be worse than any other one of these diseases .
nothing goes in my sleeve or comes out , no trickserei . and you can study everything .
a year ago or so , i read a study that really blew me .
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
sorry . if you &apos;re bad , look away , don &apos;t look .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it &apos;s immediately beginning .
and none of these stories is very erbaulich or great -- but one of them is clear .
so we have the erinnernde self , and the erlebende itself , and they &apos;re quite different .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future , is that the opposite is embedded .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he built a camera in front of the players .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life when we face hard problems .
you don &apos;t sit around , and it turns out . there &apos;s always something important to do .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are meister-spieler .
these are our meister-spieler . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at &quot; something . &quot;
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you were eating food .
that was the first strategiespiel in the world of warcraft-serie , and this was 16 years ago .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we describe with these words .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
so we have to look beyond the patologie and focus on all of human possibilities .
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , a case was done in the u.k. at the time .
if a mind has a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new daseinsformen .
and you &apos;re all going to give you all the nutrients that you could just give yourself a lot of efforts .
and the argument , here , would be the wheels of evolution , but they &apos;re unerbittlich .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
you can carry 200 pounds on top of verschiedenartiges terrain , many hours long .
we &apos;re at the same time with our industriepartner of this device , this new exoskelett in this year .

if you think you &apos;re looking good at something , it &apos;s almost safe .
and beyond the cities , all of this senses , it pulls into objects of everyday life .
now , all our objects , our environment , begin to talk to us .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
here you can see a real flyfire-steuerung , the herabsinkt , to shape , as before , to shape .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever elected farmers .
i could see it in your eyes , there was horror , life was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .

about one month after that , i came up with a show of my daughter -- erstklässler , not much künstlerisches talent ...
and more than anything else , they are the best parents they can possibly be ?
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
either floral fusion , or a &quot; paradise winds , &quot; they will have the choice .
i have to talk to the man on the street that are like me , otto-normal-verbraucher .
but normally i have a accessoire , like sonnenbrillen , or a jewelry , such a stuff .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength , rather than on both .

when i went to go and visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
there &apos;s the uffizi , the moma , the hermitage , the rijks , the van gogh .

i &apos;m going to zoom into this image of this picture , and i &apos;m going to zoom in on the rissen .
this is the first object you can see , which was in the quantenmechanischen superposition .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics is all connected to everything .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be rekonzeptualisieren as we should think about economic development .
so , we could really easily use the world with duzenden , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
and i &apos;ve come to the kernaussage that a new city will offer people new possibilities .
and they &apos;ve found that an average ceo of an average ceo is done with 139 tasks .
and this is a problem that you often see when you look at the long list of the list .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends-manager at youtube , and i look at youtube-videos .
as i said , one of the greatest stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning at youtube .
after a four-year-old and filmreifen saga , a boat still on the lake as a fischerboot .

you might think that this is just a landschaftsbild , and the bottom is manipulated .
in order to achieve a realistisches outcome , it &apos;s going to be seen from me on planning .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows have written in the last year .
and chicago , she just introduced them to the people who freischaufeln the buergersteige , if it &apos;s schneit .
this is the work very bright people in the office of the new urban city in boston .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is going to be in crowdsourcing .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is input of the other .
you can make your opinion , in any channel , at any time , and you do it .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but it &apos;s actually about the universal shape .
it &apos;s not possible that everything for forever and forever is evolving as fast .
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
i think the reason is that we realize that anything is happening .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace your dna .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms have found a way to communicate each other .
then the nächstens steps , like language and so on , is less than a million years .
it gets faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
i think it &apos;s very hochmütig to tell us that we are the end of evolution .
if we wanted to travel indians at the time , we walked into a car , and we went to the sky .
and so -- here we go , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .

and it &apos;s exciting because i beibringe my students with african-american history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
they say , &quot; no , tell people that we grew up with this . &quot;
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
every second of every day , our senses will start a lot more information than our brain can ever process .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and that is that the ernährungs- , elektrizitäts- transport- , is going to reduce a pair of glasses .
steve pinker showed us that we currently live in a very peaceful time of menschengeschichte life .
i &apos;ve been looking for the newspapers and looking for the best headlines that i could find .
imagine that this artificial intelligence would be available every single one of the besitzer .
aluminum was at that time the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platin .
and to win , the device needs to make a better diagnosis than a team of hochqualifizierter physicians .
so , what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of menschengemeinde us ?
and it showed that nowadays the human pattern is better the proteins than the best supercomputer .
and it was my mission when the notfallpersonal was given by the kardiologischen of advice to study the notfallpatienten .
and over a period of time to two hours , she started feeling better .
the unhealthy species i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you sick .
when did you hear the last time of someone who &apos;s been talking about fehlschlag about fehlschlag over fehlschlag ?

when i returned 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half his size .
there are multiple cases of online-millionären , multimillionären , which made their money by attacks .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , one opinion , or through their audience .
so western governments provide totalitäre governments with hilfsmitteln , so that they can use their own citizens .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful building .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a particular culture will find access to the material world .
in a blutbefleckten continent , these people were the only ones who have never been conquered by the spaniern .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of suffering , if you haven &apos;t experienced it on unterster level .
if we ask these myriad weltkulturen of the importance of human beings , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
the family , fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never do anything .
and that really reaches these ideas , these limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that no longer means that it should be pop-ups and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
and if you say , &quot; if you were , what would you do ? &quot;
something like that , as tiefgreifendes , is now a question of choice , how to show this slide .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , which i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which is working on the wirelesslan .
so i want to say , there were some options , but not everything was a matter of choice .
do you want to cut down the bottom , blah , blah blah , blah , &quot; and so on .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
this is almost limited to absolute safety -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
now , i told you that this is not the genesis -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
we have technologies today because of this rapid synthesemethoden to do what we call kombinatorische genetics .
we now have the ability to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very far abkühlt , you &apos;re going to be supraleitern .
but , when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently and ask me , why ?
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
the roman had the same idea , called these kinds of körperlosem creative spirit , “ genius .
this is great . the roman thought didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
she felt when it came , because it would take the earth under her feet .
so i raised my view of the manuscript , and i talked to my comment on a blank corner of the room .
so if you want to have it better , you have to pop up here , and your share of the agreement .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the hell .
but again , very rarely , something special happened . one of the performers was actually überweltlich .
and all over the world , in a really ausserordentlichen and never have unprecedented degrees .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to get us out of this misslichen .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can put in any patterns .
i can speed up the entire sequence by putting the pace into one direction or another direction .
so i don &apos;t have to plan it in the front , but i can &apos;t do improvise ; you &apos;re going to increase it .
there &apos;s now craig venter in the u.s.a , which tries to make biofuel , so gasoline from algae .
and our approach was to say , well , o.k that you don &apos;t have to do that .
and the commercial device costs about fünfzehntausend euros , or something like this , sahnespender about 50 .
what is this with virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
schamanen , priests , so-called wissenswächter , were extra abgestellt to keep knowledge in stories .
virtuality is suddenly alien to us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
and they &apos;re over the course of the centuries more and more überschrieben through the impact of the maschinenzeitalters .
but this is an essential important part , if you want to design things in the same way as well .
i have this , cognitive rückkoppelung , you have what you want to see .
that i &apos;m just making this different and doing beautiful is not that it &apos;s better .
but this brings me back to the point , and when things are things going to be more intuitive ?
and that &apos;s always a little intuitive for us to be a little bit intuitive when i think about it .
i can now inhibit this mental handlungsmodell , selektieren , informieren , übertragen on a interaktionssystem .
you could easily altöl a liter of altöl , and then the plant would ruin over years .
unfortunately , not in offenbach , but maybe you can help the frankfurtern a little bit .
this is the first green backpack , actually , that &apos;s made up in the circulation .
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and therefore you don &apos;t want to have a reputation .

she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about a student .
a third sentence , which is instantly pointing to people who have a strong sense of a soul .

in the present , we have a whole modern example , which is always going back and over again .
there was a academicians who was named johannes buridanus and after that , the esel esel .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent , and our network is physically the european european .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 two years ago , in walt disney concert hall .
it was a beautiful fish , wohlschmeckend , good consistency , gehaltvoll , a bestseller on the menu .
and at that night , i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
and here , here he sees a pattern of equanimity that he &apos;s remembered to the tansanische giraffe .
and then he goes to a little bit more talking about rare birds and algae and seltsamen .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
the pflanzliche biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , is what the fish feed .
we love wochenmärkte . we love little familienbetriebe . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
or better , how can we create conditions that empower every community to support themselves ?
capital , chemistry and machines are in there , and it has never made anything really good for food .
it &apos;s something in between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
this is really important , because this is a realization that is not in a single wikipediaseite .
if we can do this , then this past datenfalle , maybe a new source of information , maybe a new source of information .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the limits of possible .
certainly i would never get an alien world with a spaceship , which seemed quite unlikely to me .
the idea of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , in contrast to our own , kläglichen human imagination .
in &quot; abyss &quot; i mean , i could connect my preference to the unterwasserwelt and the tauchen .
and what came up with was the first computergenerierte soft-surface-figur ever to see in a movie .
sounds crazy . but it goes back back to the fact that your imagination can make a reality .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a science-fiction-film .
so let &apos;s look at each factor of each other , and we think about how we get it to zero .
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their schulaufgaben under the straßenlicht .
well , with efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
so three very difficult problems that might be solvable , and that &apos;s why you should work .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of today as a antriebsstoff .
you can see it &apos;s kind of a column , often known as &quot; wandernde wave reactor . &quot;
we need marktanreize , carbon dioxide , cap &amp; amp ; trade , trade that creates a preissignal .
we need to have dialogue , and we &apos;ve got full of all sorts of things , and the things that are done by government .
and it would be best if you can make multiple , because you could use a mixture .
there &apos;s a fluid reaktortyp , which seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe they say that .
and peter says , &quot; no one of the kids invested at the risk of being gmbh . &quot;
and that team , which is going to look down and look at the work of the team , makes a significant difference .
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , or a grundhaltung , the right prototype .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
and that &apos;s because these fanatiker , who made me feel crazy at all of the time .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
i know that they did that because half of americans do that every day .
it has no nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are building all that in it .
so in order to understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple trick .
this creates a very strong picture in the head . this is very much stronger than a white pill .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both zusammengeworfen in the idea of happiness .
and the surprise is that patients have a much worse erinnrung on the darmspiegelung than the patients .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a experiences .
but danny , in the entire american effort , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
this is going to be , i think , in the next one or two of the national statistics .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the most absolutely problems of the world .
we never have these feelings , when we play games , they just don &apos;t .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; überflieger . &quot;
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s the most powerful people in the world .
because if we could figure that out , we would have never given a human potential to be available before .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we know that as a human being , we know as a human being , if we do hard , meaningful work .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
so , for the next ted game , we have a bigger , higher goal than just ölknappheit .
the one call of gamers , you know , we &apos;ve created almost like a &quot; jerry-bruckheimer &quot; -film . &quot;
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they could read when they google &quot; superstruct . &quot;
it &apos;s about values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
and dr. love was always very colorful flying , and it was just for the work with kids .
this is just one example of a lot of how adults are able to change the imagination of a child .
our language hinkt behind the social changes that have been triggered by a technological change .
widrigkeiten are not an obstacle that we need to be able to do better with our lives .
and maybe we even know what wood we &apos;re doing when we really get tested .
and i turn around and i see this older man , i had no idea who he is .
when i first saw her , i took her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how important of this factor of a human life .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not even in the experience .
they call this &quot; streaming trials &quot; in the u.s. we call it &quot; tracking . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t necessarily interfere with the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
first of all , let &apos;s look at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
why not have the fast muskelfasern that will allow you to run faster and longer ?
his flexible design allows it to be deeply immersed , to kriechen and have highly wendige movements .
i was 24 years old , and in bestform , as a monströser purzelbaum purzelbaum , während me .

in typically , our system is based on the idea that a particular amount of anatomical intensity has a certain identity .
it &apos;s also true of race , which it turns out as much more complicated than we have been approved .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re only going to tell ourselves about a few nukleotide ?
now you might think that the whole thing would make a lot of categories like me really enjoy .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
and if you think that you don &apos;t look good at anything , you probably have right .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
now the first project i want to introduce you to is one of the first of our lab .
if those bildpunkte fall down , they can write patterns , they can write patterns , images , text .
imagine before the screen could appear in different formaten or sizes , in different auflösungen .
my heart ruined , i was schwindelig , was schwindelig , while i was trying to grab myself .
part of the ice in the eisbergen that i is very young -- a few thousand years old .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s a room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break that thing in 20 parts , as you know it .
and that sadness really sich in a thought , which is that i only want one thing .
what would you do about it , because you think you &apos;re there forever ?
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so , it was possible for us to bring the little digital sprengkopf with the rotorsteuerung .
so the rotor is this moving bit within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
so for example , the number two is going to get out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
so maybe we sell a shoe and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever worn ...
who knows , when the film comes out , we might see like a horde .
but why ? well , transparency is fear einflößend -- like this strange bear , who remains still .
the brand i am , i would say , would say , lässige fly .
and you can also see it here , target , wii , thin , mini , von and jetblue .
now , since the film at the sundance film festival had the first time , we can look at this .
if we have a scale to each other to measure , we could have their brain .
it didn &apos;t really like my intuition , and maybe just because i don &apos;t play with the particles that often .
so what &apos;s the idea of thinking about this idea of being a completely new city to be in greenville ?

and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you get there a little bit ?
because the music allows him to understand his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
they built this complicated episode of channels , and they drängten water from the land and out of the river .

there are diseases in the rich world that millions of us have only been threatened by one generation yet .
in front of a decade ago , i wrote an article about the new yorker , a little article .
but that article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it .
a few weeks ago , i wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said i &apos;m a little bit of schrill .

they &apos;ve heard of &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 powers &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
until today , all the world of warcraft-spieler have spent millions of years trying to solve the virtual problems of azeroth .

through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separated from nature and that everything is connected .
it starts with the high school , and then the schimpfwörter , then the schimpfwörter , after all , they do the art and the final ones .

in south africa , people understood that the rassentrennung is not reaching without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can adjust the development .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i here at ted is a new university called singularity university .

so we think that this is a situation in the software that can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , that digital information really will be accurate .
triplets of this letter -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that will have changed a lot of biology at a time .
and it &apos;s just nurmale selection . we can go to lebensfähigkeit selektieren , production of chemicals and treibstoffproduktion and so on .

he then built this helmet that this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum , it went to the museum .
now we think our love to stories depends on the fact that we sat on the lap of our parents .
and this game is connecting the virtual world , so the data that we produce , which we produce with the real world .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing right now .
so a lot of natural , in a branch , but i kind of see exactly where is salt and pepper in it .
and on the left , it &apos;s just intuitive , and i hope that no sugar is in there , which is the salt .

so as fast as the mikroprozessor-technologie advances would be , then we could get into a taxi , and in 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
that was unprecedented in history before in the history of technologie-entwicklung , this kind of rekursivem growth , which is increasing the scale every few years of exponentially .
in fact , the tröpfchen , which had one for growth , had faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from outside and shared faster .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible to design this in the traditional sense .
of course , the chance of accident is very small , is very small of an accident , that they &apos;re just a number of pieces of sortieren , so they &apos;re probably not going to do this .

but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite like pein , if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning , the most extraordinary aspects of your existence come from you .
i think that molecular biology is generally speaking , so in general , biotechnology , everything you count about it , synthetic biology and so forth .
so , of course , as crazy as that in the context of my talk , we &apos;re moving to physically not existenten , virtual worlds , after the model of the holodecks .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are you going to start with all these sorts of natural , archaischen urformen of communication , interaction and so forth .
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , here &apos;s a little bit short , we &apos;re now moving from the third to the fourth gesellschaftsgeneration or gesellschaftsform .
that means that the local village has become a global village with the same principles , of course , of course , but the total transparency .

and something interesting happened . because what i was fascinated to jacques shows about jacques cousteaus shows the idea of a completely unknown world here on earth itself .
anyway , in the same part of the piece of curiosity and science . it was all . it was an adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
because we did all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in a row .
so , again , i said , again , with a small team on unbekanntem &apos;s terrain , and we used to have a new technology with a new technique that didn &apos;t exist before .

bg : well , we need one of those skalierbaren things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use .

if you go on this path , where you believe and magic and magic and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not that stupid , it &apos;s not that stupid , and it &apos;s durchsticht the skin for us for a few minutes . &quot;
they didn &apos;t care because he was a reminder of a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .

this is an graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , why we are better in the real life .
we trust that there &apos;s a time when the rules are going to be eingehalten , that we have the same goal , and we have to stay the same target .
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
and imagine , i even have known as a fünfjähriges child with dr. love , and i &apos;m trying to stop that practice , natürllich without success .
they were just told that they were the einser-schüler and the students with the grade , and they &apos;ve taught them something , and they &apos;re being treated .
and as we speak about bacteria , you know , every one of us in our gut is more bacterial than cells in the rest of our body ?
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t just natural , but led and decided from us as a individuen. in the decisions that we do .
play is a formwandler and it can take a lot of shapes , some of which are slightly quiet , phantasievoll , curious -- maybe to recognize that .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore , and we interact with it , and the unexpected ones that we &apos;re creating are the most fundamental of creativity .
i want you to think of two couples , in 1979 , in 1979 , right now , in exactly the same moment , every zeugt baby -- okay .

about three or four years ago , i received a call from the night in the middle of the night , woman post , &quot; i have to see it .
now , when it comes to us , the systems that control drehzahlen and valves , we can actually make a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
and i called them up and zapfte their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and if you manipulated the speed of this rotors , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor and eventually explode the centrifuge .
so , the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of the life , actually , you get to fund the film ?
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use perspective , because this has a negative konnotation -- but you know how it &apos;s going to evolve ?
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth a few really familiar brands .
i think , &quot; well , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category actually makes a difference to something positive , as opposed to &quot; fighting smell and moisture . &quot;
now , there are marken brands and achtsame brands , these things that come and go , but a verspielte , achtsame brand is a pretty strong thing .

unfortunately , sometimes even kids who are trying to find their parents , who they have , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen them in some cases .
so what is it for an idea to insist on that every family has a choice between a number of cities who are in competition around new residents ?
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read and ask them to clap , if you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s supply .

when i was a kid , the future was somewhere in 2000 , and people talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then there &apos;s a pretty good picture of how they do it .
so we take something very complicated , and it turns it into sounds around , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
and it connects us all together to something that is much greater and also able to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
i know and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job because you come from a series of hunderttausenden programs , which have the job done .
we bring our kids closer and closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and love and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
she took me out and said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t have it . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old south , and i have a brother who is a year older and a year older sister .
how it would feel like living in a world where the german state would let people live , especially when they were under a lot of jews .

and every year we ask the students to create companies and services and services within a decade that can affect the lives of billions of people .
and then their orders expand , they come from the head , and they &apos;re very hard to see , and they &apos;re very difficult to tell their stories .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in sophisticated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
we want the world of creators , the inventor , the mitwirkenden , because that world we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
now there are some among us that , i think , that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of the being , &quot; really different ways of being .

this tribe , the cofan , have 17 varieties of ayahuasca that you all recognize in big distance in the forest for our eyes as a way .
most of them are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the kongressbibliothek and it &apos;s in a field of 300 megapixeln .
and this is something that is through complexity , with the people who use it , and it &apos;s going to use it , and it &apos;s becoming greater and bigger for the user .
if people have freedom , each of us is about to do things that maximize our common public and nobody has to decide for us .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether this means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you and not to get a good note in my class .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inerte chemical and put in a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made the viral particles .
and i told you that we might be able to create a new form of kambrischen explosion in which there might be massive new artenbildung based on this digital design .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to get the fact that we &apos;re going to reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
and what &apos;s going on with the creative enterprise is that they make us secure about the rise of global health -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construction , which protect you from the consequences of your work .
it &apos;s kind of a very sad thing for the hackerszene , because it &apos;s not that that &apos;s what it actually really did , and what it &apos;s really starting to do .
another thing from the united states , which has just been to do with this vaterschaftstestgeschichte , is the p.c.r , which is the polymerase-kettenreaktion , complicated word .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap yet , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s going to be clear .
and if you can also make a good decision as a informierter citizen in society , you want to be able to do it , you want to have access to knowledge and technology .
and this kind of wealth that makes the virtual reality , the reality that people have needed in the vorindustriellen times , because they had nothing .
and as you can see , this is a very inselreiches area , and you had to kind of navigate , from island to iceland , to get food .
so , instead of remembering us , we have standardized , widespread , wide distributed patterns of memories that we can hang on our personal memories .
right now , directly , and it &apos;s not for the company puma by se per se , but that they &apos;re now helping this business to make these products successful .

this one of the verweis that the innersten was already known that he was actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that .
and if you have this premise of view , you can understand the logic that we &apos;re very lucky to experience through a lie of our world .
it looks something like this , who doesn &apos;t have any willensfreiheit , can &apos;t be pulled for his actions and claims to responsibility and therefore it &apos;s unzurechnungsfähig .
and yes , a lot of what i &apos;ve been saying is , i think , a lot of , because many , many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve lived in too .
as big as it would have to be a battery , so you would have an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 40 , 50 , 50 , 50 percent renewable .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the israelis .
that our system also has a preisanstieg , it &apos;s because we &apos;re going to make 20 percent of diesel , and we don &apos;t have a preissteigerung on the other .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years , in the last 30 years .

now , after i voted &apos; government , i know that the wikipediakategorien , the most meisten , are going to be magazines people at the time .

but the messlatte hit quite nicely , and people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do that .
and it made me aware of this telepräsenz-erlebnis that you could use these roboterhafte , and that &apos;s what your consciousness is in the vehicle , in these other forms of existence .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but now i &apos;m sure you can also have an director , an education director , a leader like a schiffskapitän or something .
now , the exact context between a co2-anstieg and the dadurch , and where their other consequences are , there are some questions , but not very many .
the terrapower-konzept means that instead of part of the urans , one percent one percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
we should use the effektivitätsmaßnahmen to make reduction on the way , the less we get , the more likely to be , and the temperature is going to be the temperature .

bill , i think i &apos;m talking for almost all the people here , if i say , i really hope your wish is going to be true . thank you very much .
the average for most of it lies at about 50cm , bwl-studenten , and half of them are doing something more , but not much , kindergartenkinder more than the adults .
drinking water , urbares land , oil , gas , gas : they disappear , and it &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of that chaos , we &apos;re going to go away .
now , what i &apos;m hearing is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monokultur , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be very high time to understand what that means .
how to raise happiness is very different depending on how they think and whether they think about the erinnernde self or whether they think about the erlebende self .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people that we like people , after playing with them , even when they have played us bad with them .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the old greek historikers , you may be familiar with this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
so , we &apos;re not just responsible for people we love to preserve schicksalsschlägen , but they prepare to come to it .
you have to separate two things : to be the medical fact , an divine fact , and for the other social opinion , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
but true also is a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to rising challenges , through greater creativity and druch cooperation .
so gender is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be spread over the whole range , you can be spread over the whole range .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and interact in the world .
and since they haven &apos;t heard of me as the woman who runs up here at ted in her underwear -- it &apos;s called , i found some things .
we found one for them , we took them , and we took them around , and we gave them eight , because it needed to be , it needed to be eight .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , in terms of the windows- part , the dropper- part , and he made a huge amount of zero- schwachstellen .
and if you &apos;ve already heard that the dropper of stuxnet complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the nutzdaten are a science for itself .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing like this -- spaßig at the beginning , a little hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
what i want to do is to make a film around product placement , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .

so the first case : all the trillion atoms of atoms that make the piece of metal are still there , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down .

i loved going to this business , but at one time i asked myself , well , what is it that you &apos;re never doing ?
it also puts me into excitement about the great product that i &apos;m making , and so i &apos;m ready to be able to be with interest with interest .
it &apos;s not particularly scientifically scientifically -- it provides a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how is it ? &quot;

the sioux-indianer didn &apos;t seem to be on sioux , as she did , when she got bow and arrow , when the americans stopped being americans , when the americans stopped .

now , of course , in a kind of a constructive form of accidents , again , the debate of science and ingenieurskunst of the value of science , it &apos;s easy to reject . it &apos;s easy to reject .
because it makes sense as much sense as anything else that i &apos;ve heard of , when it went to explain the absolutely crazy machende of creative process .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me that he was going to go one day in los angeles , and there was anything for him .

the second aspect is that since this archaischen models , we &apos;ve been able to speak very , very carefully , even though we &apos;re using a language of language .
but for me , in the realm of interactive media as a particularly impressive thing to remember , we have in our biological memory , the ability to think about it .

i would be so umschreiben , not the most powerful of its kind , and not the most powerful of his species , but the one that can adapt to the best .
there is the usual . the typical thing . but not the normal . and would you really want to know this poor , gray person , if it really would be there ?

i think we would all be able to figure out the mood , the woody of all the things that , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do immortality through my work .
and by the way , we go around and mutate and mix so much that they can &apos;t say no longer , that isolation is necessary , for evolution , for evolution .
so think if it wasn &apos;t just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to use genetic adaptations to heal the diseases and prevent the disease .
it &apos;s not going to take longer until the reality is going to be a thousand dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
here are also batteriepackungen , the motorantrieb is on their hips , as well as their kniegelenken , which they move forward in this rather geschmeidigen and very natural gait .
there &apos;s a place where the women that women have , with sex &apos; saying , &quot; hello , &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious thing .
we know them as &quot; love instead war , &quot; because they have häufigen , also bisexuellen sex , with wechselnden partners , and rules so conflicts and social scientists .

we gave it a little push , we could put it in the same time , and not vibrate -- something only in quantum mechanics allows .
the head of congress came up on the stage , and he said , &quot; professor , i thank you for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .

and after a very short time , all of the characteristics of the species had lost and konvertierte completely into a new species on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
we have now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the designkomponenten of the future .
we &apos;re more complex from people to improve it , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
so it &apos;s far . and for all those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment ever considered -- 27 kilometers in diameter .

here in the image on the left , you see biocurious , which is a hackerspace , so basically a school , like a private school , a private school , where everyone can get .
kids , old , all kinds of people going out there to just go through it , you have a lab and look at what you can do , if you look at what you do .
or what you normally understand under a lab , these are sort of abgefahrene machines , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , highly distanziert , educated academics with doktortitel and so on .
and what we have is not legal , but that &apos;s , you know , i think , quite well , i think , pretty well , that people are very well aware of this .
we all know that the interactive media is nonlinear by definition of what the linearity of the linearity has , and of course , what tells us is that we feel the linearity today .
and if i say computer data , they have very likely to realize that any people in front of some konsolen herumhappeln , or they &apos;re playing with some kind of konsole in the hand .
when you get more intuitive and then i have to go back to my little friend here , and look at what does this mean , because of the point of view , what does it mean ?
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the highest , right ?
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of trying to remove the dangers , the other only when they fire fire .
it &apos;s a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that is , as if the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and determined .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , it &apos;s gezielter , bigger , reinzoomen , rauszoomen , you don &apos;t just want to do it or you can &apos;t just do it .
and in that community , you realize that the most important thing is that the most important thing you &apos;ve got is because you &apos;ve overcome a task that you can &apos;t tell anyone else .
so when i get back to my next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you would be respected and deserved in return .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the gesundheitsvorsorgung and reproduktionsmedizin , we might be able to reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope to 1.3 .
he &apos;s still going to , because of his former stories associated with the skeptiker-camp , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s going to get it now .
none of them -- gingko , betrug , betrug , acai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars , it &apos;s cheating .
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do that as far as we do , we &apos;re guilty of something that we don &apos;t want to be guilty about , i don &apos;t want to be conservative colonialism .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem as good as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem as good as a capsule , which doesn &apos;t seem as good as the needle .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out that we use all the time to play this whole time , actually , changes what we are as human beings .
the spieleindustrie entwickelt , which is saving energy , saving energy and working on mobilfunknetzen , rather than players all around the world , especially in india , in india , in india .
maybe this is the process that &apos;s just looking at what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix that , for every single disability than the pathology providers .
is it clear that we can use that , and the mechanisms of a common bacterium can be requirieren to produce the protein of the human genome system that &apos;s used to treat the generators ?
in this huge unvollendeten symphony of the universe , life on earth is only bemessen ; the animal kingdom , like a single ball , and the human life , a small notenverzierung .
and the reason for that would be that , first of all , through medicine , we were able to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been rausgewählt and from the population .
i want you to imagine a bit now , a portable robot that gives you übermenschliche skills , or a different one that helps you go up and go up again .
fleischhandel and decline in the decline that you can &apos;t fill a stadium with the verbliebenen bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
but it &apos;s mostly until you reach puberty and growing your breasts and develop yourself , but you don &apos;t get your period , until someone comes to it , that &apos;s something different .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was in the same way that the doctors were found that he was inside female .
while we keep our science on our science , we get increasingly into a zone of the world where we need to recognize that the simplistischen categories that we &apos;ve had probably very much simple .
one of the areas that we see in the beipiel , in our culture today , in our modern culture , are the struggle about the beginning and the end of life .
while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m also going to leave you with some of the lessons that i have , whether you believe it or not , have learned from those abenteuern , not to wear anything new .
a few years ago , it was that if you wanted to win a formula , you would take your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
so i came up with the need , just a check , and instead i had a check out , from which i didn &apos;t have the slightest idea of how i was going to get it .
so , the weckte really , really interested , and we started working with it , almost round the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
so i started making scientific literature about how this zentrifugen was built in natanz , and found that they were strukturiert in what &apos;s called kaskaden , and each kaskade contains 164 zentrifugen .
i have a check in my pocket , pointed out on the oberorganisation of the ted-organisation , the sapling-stiftung -- a check in height of dollars to spend my ted-auftritt in the next year .
but i bet that playing it with a very valuable lesson , which is a very valuable lesson , not just to get you past , and that you stay in a place .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of people who were able to be able to make a rentensparplan plan , the probability of the ability to be saved whether more for tomorrow .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we tested on different kinds and different types of data -- that they can just apply in their business .
and it turns out that if you make it that something feels specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to make people save more .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i always want to let it look like you could have on a photo .
so every morning i went to my wlan-waage and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a little lettuce today , lucien . &quot;
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home to their physician and to share it with other people , for some more than 100 dollars .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. state of town who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizens , to adopt the citizens .
and because the government ended up their power of us -- erinner you : &quot; we do the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to affect how this change happens .
but then another thing happened , very interesting , where things were completely different , which started to communicate these cells and exchange information , so that communities from cells emerged .
so these communities started moving , so that the level , on which evolution was happening , was no longer the individual , but the whole zellengemeinschaft that we call organism .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and i got this sixpack beer with grabbed my sister and i went to the forest .
now , with all our digital devices that we have seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
think that a large percentage of americans who live under the poverty line are access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv , mobile phones , cell phones and cars .
if i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of opportunities .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little bit less likely to talk to you about .
maybe i wanted to be so successful , and so could be able to make sure that i was so able to take care of my patients without having to contact with it .
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people have been touched by this -- except from the pocahontas-geschichte , why were they so touched by the bilderwelt ?
so i &apos;d like to take you to a journey today in a tour of the ethnosphäre , a brief journey through the ethnosphäre , to try and understand what &apos;s really lost .
offspring of the old tyrannischen civilization , the caribbean küstenebene of colombia , moved into the eroberung of the elected , in the eroberung , this people in a isoliertes vulkanisches , which is increasing over the karibischen küstenebene .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new lives and building new lives .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way forward to the front that this chromosome is actually to locate what allows us to vary the individual components and make some of these fundamental questions .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would be really berechtigte scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- feen , people nachfolgen and feenzauber on their projects and so on .
if you may just believe that you &apos;re a loan -- from a unvorstellbaren source for a erlesene time of your life that &apos;s passed to someone else when you &apos;re done with it .
while they realized how to avoid the hands and zugreift the klötze , and they actually learned how to solve and solve problems through the understanding and to change through understanding of life .
and it &apos;s just been done with software , but there &apos;s also it in the elektronikbereich , and there &apos;s also a whole bastlerszene , there &apos;s a whole bastlerszene that &apos;s going to do with all kinds of things .
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s like , and this is a kind of a hirnwellenmessgerät , e.e.g or something like this , so he &apos;s engaged with neurobiologie , his nickname is sam neurohack .
because , as i said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have pretty little idea of it , and also no chance to make a really good job .
that means clarity , if you know that , pay attention to who you like , because i don &apos;t have a gewähr for what can happen .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours more , but your employers or your employer , and then you &apos;ve got to be able to do it with the four hours .
and if you put the people who when you put it in people , if you say it &apos;s better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re raffgierig .
at this point and when you laugh , you know how important this lie is and how much time you need to know what artists can tell us .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , to practice this courage to lie .
i &apos;m grateful for the premium-kola-mensch that he &apos;s got the word again , because after the mauerfall , you could not use the word , because everything left was bad .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to grow in the sea , so far out in the sea that you don &apos;t get rid of the environment . &quot;
some people say , you know , not only work on insurance because you &apos;re probably kidding , so you &apos;re going to keep eating , because you know , you &apos;re going to save the herzoperation .
but because this is not happening here , we can do it in denial , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and see messages from fear and analphabetismus of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
but i think in this context , and with the purpose of a deception , i &apos;m going to just put the needle out there , and go from the stage .
from the point of view , if you have a vacation , and the second week is as good as the first one , then the zweiwöchige vacation is twice as good as the einwöchige vacation .
if people take this seriously seriously , i mean , it &apos;s all on the head to put everything we believe in , for example , and so on .
so here we have a full parallelbildungsweg , which is the young people learning as well , what it means to be a good player like everything else they learn in school .
this was dr. kean , a man i just knew from my mother &apos;s tales about this day , because i was , of course , to my birthday two weeks .
and most of all , we &apos;re ever going to be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to do to make these decisions ?
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord spinal cord living in their lifetime -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 90s , and the wheelchair was the only option .
i want to argue that i probably know some light labradorhunde , which are fähiger , are more intelligent , more intelligent and more mature decisions to meet their sexual relationships than some people who i know .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future , if we have democracy about anatomy -- to think less about the individual bodies of what affects identity , and think more about relationships .
and finally , saturday : to develop a unique , unique style , is a great way to tell the world about a little bit , without saying a word .
it started with a question of the bürgermeisters , which came to us and said that spain and südeuropa have a beautiful tradition in public places to use water as part of architecture .
and one of the ideas that were at mit in a arbeitskreis ermittelt , imagine this schläuche , and valves , magnetventile , work , open and close .
but then it could be just a 3d cloud of bildpunkten that you can go through and move through that you can move through , and look at a lot of directions .
now , for the first time -- and the campaign of obama has demonstrated this -- we can move from the digital world , from the sich forces to the physical world .
but tomorrow , it can allow us to make the next challenges -- think of climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to the physical world ?
and i &apos;m just going to talk to him , and i said , &quot; wait , is this not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all of the paralyzed people through these devices ? &quot;
but if we can do it that an effective tool on a laptop will be used by one laptop , that gray box is used to konfigurieren , then we &apos;re in business .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of branding and sponsoring , i knew i was going to do something a little different .
so , 18 months ago , i did something else in google , and i went to do something with museums and doing things with museums and art . my chefin , which is what i &apos;m talking about today .
i mean , it can sound odd to think that a thing at the same time is at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed it .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually quanten objects that are put together in a small room .
we &apos;ve got six different tastes out there , or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first of all , i think , what kind of case would i have more people standing there and try ?
i had to worry that it was not free , and it was my job to learn that the story was going to be tried to zerdrücken us , but we did it .
every dollar has been given , and it was put in more education for english and mathematics , whatever we needed to do for it , mostly the new stuff that came out of hand .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to get them together , together , to play some kind of game , to control their health better .
so they either survived together , or they would go together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeated more often , and by evolution .
it &apos;s this kopf-herz-verbindung that i think is driving us , not just being open for all the light and begeisternden things , but for the dark and problematischen .
there &apos;s no way to make technology and design that allows us to be fully human as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears and injustice .
so these are just some of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
they use tools like the staatstrojaner to bespielen their computer with a trojaner that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their online-diskussionen abzuhören , their passwörter .
here &apos;s a photograph i took on the northern end of the baffin-inseln , when i went to the narwhal-jagd , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and finally , i think it &apos;s quite obvious , at least for those of us who &apos;ve traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not even removed .
they represent parts of the human imagination that zurückreichen in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our own children , are part of the geography of hope .
and of course , the byproduct of all of this is the immense , virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that are not just through überflüge or satellite images and so on , but by collective memory .
and then they go to the verbraucher-elektronik business to zusammenzustellen a stereo -- speakers , cd-player , a kassetten-player , radio , verstärker . and in that one electronics , there are so many stereo facilities .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl demonstrated , with technology that allows us to work every minute from every day from every day on the planet -- to the randolph hotel .
it &apos;s a picture of the first strahlenpartikels which the entire route around the lhc , then absichtlich with a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to be writing from now on the world &apos;s work is going to be the work after the abgefahrenen success of my last book , right ?
because ... at the end of it , it &apos;s like follows , centuries ago , in the deserts of nordafrikas people with sacred tänzen , and music gathered together for hours -- until dawn .
an interesting episode of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures to data , like colors , like colors , how to do this with liquids .
i graduated in graduate school and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the bachelorarbeit of michael burk , ann-kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan-moritz müller .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , and why is there a little bit of a täschchen , where there &apos;s no such thing as a little bit of reinpasst , and so on , you can &apos;t get a lot of money from money , even though it &apos;s not so handy ?
when we go back to the art of software , this is the first line line line , which was very abstract , where you &apos;ve taken months to deal with these systems .
not to burn a little bit better , and to lose it , and to lose it , and lose the whole materials for kreisläufe , but first to ask , how do you apply cycles ?
but at the time , you know , as an interpreter of an interpreter of knowledge , you know , as an interpreter , the composers that you play more times , and it &apos;s always getting easier to feel in it .
i &apos;ve become a day older , which is moving seasons , and my pulse will slow down at night than the morning , in a summer , it takes longer that sound comes back back home than that .
after which logic , these self-deception , these self-deception , the willingness , a different reality , as the ones that we know , are actually in the world we know that it &apos;s gültig .
the beautiful thing is that you &apos;re on this island , basically , in this island , where we &apos;re going to be able to get some problems that we &apos;re going to get if we want to increase our share of renewables .
i need to say that nathaniel ablehnte a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric and thorazin and handschellen , a trauma that he had his whole life .
and in the same way , nathaniel was when we started with our first class in walt disney disney , he had this insane flackern in his eyes , and he felt completely lost .
and like a miracle , he took his violin and began to play some snippets from violinkonzerten , and then asked me to play them at the end : mendelssohn , tschaikowski , sibelius .
as soon as it &apos;s done , if it &apos;s like you promised it , it &apos;s all clearly , you know , because the wirtschaftlichkeit , the energy density is so different , as we know it .
because , you know , you &apos;re very short in front of a kostendurchbruch and funded the learning market , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be a lot cheaper .
it requires that we all take our senses to the task , and that we think we &apos;re going to use our minds , how our feelings and our doing , in the challenge , that lies in front of us .
but if you take the shape that you give in the placebo , for example , change in a smaller pill , and that blue color and a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable more effectively .
so , i propose if you &apos;re going to be very happy , you &apos;re going to look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know , you know , i &apos;m going to do the first one , i &apos;m going to go back to the back here .
it &apos;s true for laien , thinking about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just like any other .
imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of the urlaubs , all of your images get wiped out and you get a amnestisches drug , so you &apos;ll remember nothing .
everyone who &apos;s not going to be different from the terms of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers that have vermasselt the exploration of happiness for a long long time in this particular way .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is say , in climate .
and they would be so blown into the würfelspiel , because games are so intriguing and we &apos;re with befriedigender productivity , glückseliger productivity that they would forget there was nothing to eat .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
and to be honest , the only real and vulnerable disability that i had to take apart is that the world is always in the case , it can describe me with these definitions .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all of its forces and possibilities and recognize and recognize , in addition to the natural fight , we need to be able to do another disease .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve seen so many people who opened doors to me , rather than to meet people who kept my mind or to give me an idea .
from an evolutionary point of view , they are , and i like booster rockets to send the genetic fracht into the next stage of orbit to go to the ocean .
and then the analytical technique , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to adopt verabschieden , hyper-kapazitäten -- the better memory .
they &apos;re nothing other than something that they do in the morning , giving them extra strength and increase their pace , and that will help them keep their balance .
so if i look in this room and see people who have either reached a success success , or on their way there , i want to offer this memory : wait , don &apos;t wait .
that is , it could give something , on average , which is where women &apos;s brains are different from male brains , which make us aufmerksamer social relationships , and aufmerksamer for the schutzbedürftige .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people who use things that we design .
and the coolste of this is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it &apos;s going to give you this april , in the middle of the middle of los angeles , an exhibition called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with augenerfassungstechnologie , but i &apos;ve just got a little confused , and i just got a little bit confused with amazing people so we could put something together on the legs .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
and if you play with your particles , all of these kinds of strange things -- like they &apos;re flying right through walls , or they can be at the same time at two different places .
so i was asked by the president of honduras , which meant that we need to do this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way our country &apos;s gone .
the fact is that you look at the first time , more information had more information than the second time , but i would be able to think that it &apos;s real time .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like knotenpunkte , to behave in the world around the world .
but more importantly , this app is that you represents a new generation , which is the problem of government -- not as the problem of a verknöcherten institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things in common , you have to build the only systems .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i basically put grunzende sounds of mine in the hope of creating a similar idea in your head , which has a certain resemblance with my original idea .
i live in the building of computers , and i know that i &apos;m going to use the mechanism i &apos;m using to build computers , not use , without the latest progress in computing .
ladies and gentlemen , what makes me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals in order to confront the great challenges of our planet .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , verlies the hospital and went to drive the car to the car , when i did something i didn &apos;t do .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen after ms. printers , but one of the three words to me and fear these three words that i know .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , that a orthopäde would have lost the wrong leg in my hospital , they believe i would have problems in the eyes .
so a few weeks ago , we brought to risd , and we gave them some designers that didn &apos;t have any technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; what . &quot;
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face , or seeing the character , didn &apos;t find that this was business business of the devil , and killed the five missionare with the spear .
you know , we really -- moderate goals like the ersatz of the entire petrochemischen industry . right ? if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where you could do it , where ? a hauptquelle of energy .
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remember in his 40 years as a chemist , where he was asked whether he was afraid to be chemists .
it was as if the time of stillstehen and the dancers come through a kind of pforte , he did nothing different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but all laid together .
if a performer in spain is doing some unmögliches , something magical has done : „ allah , olé , olé , allah , great , bravo , großartig , großartig , da .
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic eiskappe , the arctic arktische , had the size of the lower 48 states in order to cut 40 percent .
and if these tools are going to develop physical and a conscious awareness of their movements , they can see each other and the intricacies of our umgangs with them , then we can begin to start out with the research of new and entertaining interaktionsarten .
so , i think i &apos;d like to do it all the time to do this in german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be like translation to me in translation of translation .
now , there &apos;s the grades of all other things as an accurate record of the composer , but only a framework , i &apos;m now looking at this framework , so i &apos;m now looking at this framework to make sense of meaning and meaning .
it &apos;s not too late to start to find out if you can &apos;t do it or learn how to do these little muscles that are going to be using the vocal chords , right .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and in all of us , the talk of premium is that you may be able to be a collective , and you can use a collective energy , and there &apos;s a little bit together .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a unreinheiten , he &apos;s got tremendous , because the water that comes through this farm comes from the river .
businesses that are not the worlds for themselves , businesses , rather than aufzubrauchen , businesses that are growing , rather than just intense , farmers who are not just erzeuger , but experts for relationships .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with websites -- and we can bring it to every single website like this .
and then we actually created a reality for six months later , in which i went into a russian tauchboot , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic through a bullauge .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the fensters .
klimaverschlechterung means that their saaten are not going to grow over many years , and it &apos;s too much rain , and things are going to change , and things will change the way that they can &apos;t deal with their environment .
the kohlerevolution drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the elektrizitätspreis and therefore we have refrigerators , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
in order to understand that right , that means deep to build in the ground , almost like a vertical column of nuclear brennstoffs , that verbrauchten , and then the process is going to go up and work further down ?
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built this , so everyone who has been a fast reactor , a kandidatat for our first .
and finally , soon before they don &apos;t have time anymore , someone takes the marshmallow , and they put it carefully on the top , step back , step back and , &quot; ta-da ! admire your work . &quot;
but what then , almost always happens , is that the &quot; ta-da &quot; is going to be a &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallows is that the whole thing hits , and einstürzt .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we think we &apos;re seeing , what we believe is that we feel really comfortable .

but i have to understand in the core , understand when information becomes information , when information becomes information , when it comes from information and from information , so i know how to make things more intuitive or more of a sudden .
now , when i look at all these people , i know that the majority of these are regierungsbeamte . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss .

and this sounds and the rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region , and , of course , also enabled that you could defragmentieren these songs and put it differently , and go back to the left , to the right and the left .

but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never have a sensible simulate , whether it would work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you can see that it &apos;s doing it .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo-effekt . it seems strange that a magician is interested in it , because it &apos;s like me , as i think , as &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to be , &quot; when someone thinks it &apos;s just enough . &quot;

i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that , if things come faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .

&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; something that my friends in autodesk call &quot; infinite-computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that allow them to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , treibstoffe and artificial intelligence .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magic göttliches , which was believed that literally it lives in the walls of a künstlerateliers -- about like dobby , the hauself and the artists at work in the work of the work .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all gods and mystery , and there is no more room for mystic creatures .
and the problem that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be simple , it can be easy , which is , you know , a problemstellung , a frage , a question , and how you do it differently .
and then it came from the do-it-yourself-bio website of the founder , and has said , &quot; well , we really have to meet , too , too , and then have two things organized , and then there &apos;s two things organized in london , in the san , in san francisco .

in some of the folgenden expeditions , i saw creatures in thermalquellen , and sometimes things i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and for the science at that time , when we saw it , had no words .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica , the most clearly the best vacation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think quite often in relation to how often i think of others .
so what you got was this : your name here is : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and the other thing that you could do , and the ears would be able to fly to the ears , especially if i put your company to your involvement .

the computervision-algorithmen have been following these images with the real room , where these images , which all in the kanadischen lakes , were being made in the canadian world , and you see , there are elements of stabilisierten slides , or panoramischer , and these things have been put in relation to each other .
but if we look at these metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but when we look at all of these genes that we can eliminate , it would be very unlikely to have a living cell .
but we &apos;re not even zucken when we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve known this kind of narrative since so long . somehow we &apos;ve been verinnerlicht the notion of the notion that creativity and suffering that creativity and suffering , at the end -- always leads to the seelenqual .
in other paintings , she was not fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and the poem rolled through her , and she would go through the country , and she said , &quot; „ , &quot; after a different poet . &quot;
now , not exactly what i hoped i had , but i went -- the stairs up , the hallway over the hallway , on the &quot; the real &quot; of the &quot; the real &quot; feuerwehrmännern , &quot; that &apos;s where the bedroom was pretty much ready to get a pair of shoes .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of 19 years ago , who was born as a young boy , as young , he had a friend , he had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend , and he had just figured out that he had a gebärmutter .
so we have a situation like this , the further our science of science , we have to have to admit that these categories , that those categories , that these categories that we &apos;ve given for the stable categories , which made very simple zuordnungen , is much more powerful than we have .
we don &apos;t have the situation for instance , for example , in iran , where a man who &apos;s been attracted to other men &apos;s own men , who is being punished , because it &apos;s ready to put in a geschlechtsumwandlung , which is the case he can stay alive .

and where you see how far we &apos;re going away from what we really wanted to do and we could , and how sad we are that we are at all on earth , you can see that , for example , there &apos;s a program that has a program , until 20 years you want to be here .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to 70 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s still the rest of the rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable associated with , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re doing it .

a group of ankara that i met a while ago , which is a studentengruppe , who wanted to be able to convey more to the public , what they learn in college , and they &apos;ve been doing so on straßenfesten small actions , and people were trying to explain what d.n.a is .

now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a frage-und-antwort-sitzung for one of my lectures , who had a story .
in this picture , i &apos;ve taken a bush as a center of the verzweigungen in all directions , because if you look at the margins of life , all existing spezien on the tips of these branches have succeeded in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; it &apos;s got his surroundings and strength .

but what &apos;s happened is 17 markenpartner , who were willing to get rid of these control , who wanted to do with someone to do things like that , and make mistakes like me , and finally , to tell stories that we don &apos;t usually have been able to tell -- stories that were never going to support a werber .
this is an rekonstruktion of the cathedral , dame dame , who &apos;s just in the computer with pictures of flickr , just give you notre dame , and you &apos;re going to get pictures of men in your t-shirts and on the universitätsgelände and so on . every one of these orange kegel is a picture that has been detected as this model .

that might seem to be a little bit more abwegig , so i repeat it , so that it can work : if we have problems like hunger , poverty , poverty , climate policy , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
it would be great if we have this paradigm of ordinary versus another possibility , or the strength to actually put it a little bit more dangerous , and so we can exchange the forces of very much , very many children , and invite them to support their very special and valuable skills into society .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bakterielles chromosome , and it has more than 580.000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we were building it in kassetten of the size of a living cell .
and then , if you think of the software that we &apos;ve just seen , it &apos;s going to be able to understand why the percent of our software is little intuitive , or not based on anhieb , which is i-pad , in many areas , or i-phone , even though it &apos;s a lot more intuitive than classic software .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and to do the nasa , and in the office , and they &apos;re going to go to russia , and they go back to russia , they go back to russia , and they go to the international weltraumstation and take our 3d-kamerasysteme .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the national academy for francis arnold and willem stemmer , two scientists who developed independent techniques of evolution that are encouraging the natural process of creating the natural process of evolution .

no biologist would go to say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are just before extinction , because it just isn &apos;t true , and yet , this -- the apokalyptischste szenarium on the field of biological diversity -- is almost not what we refer to as the optimistischstes of cultural diversity .
and that was really , really , really , very bitter , and then you get into the stage , just in a phase , where i &apos;ve been asked to give you a picture of 10 years ago , a thousand years ago , which is , of course , the great thing to do .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve figured that out -- you know , the psychological presence for about three seconds . what means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a lifetime . most of them don &apos;t have any trace .
