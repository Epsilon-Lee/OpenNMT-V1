we &apos;re taking off .
i represent children .
they had to worry about being bombed .
i couldn &apos;t bear it .
it would be unconscionable .
we love innovation .
we love entertainment .

sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
we have online criminals .
they sell certificates .
they speared each other .
