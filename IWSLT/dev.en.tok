my grandmother was a homemaker .

i love this dish .

this isn &apos;t easy stuff .
they keep going on forever .
so that &apos;s the conventional approach .
these are two magnets .
you could abuse it .
we clearly can .
you make lots of money .
shut it down at once . &quot;
everything else is mandated .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
it &apos;s a waste product .
that &apos;s a violin .
and you know what ?
it &apos;s pretty bleak .
our thinking is backwards .
rg : uh oh .
my mother was english .

what has been my challenge ?
they need your empathy .
online dictionaries must be different .
i don &apos;t get it .

it &apos;s highly commercial .
and that would be bad .
they have the same architecture .
i thank you very much .
how do things like this happen ?
how do we get out ?
evolution helps us .
spread the word .
and why not ?

steaming piles of humus .
and this changes gradually .
here , craig is working the head .
you see the skeletal structure of it .
so , we have this ability as well .
now we don &apos;t think that way .
this is actually in a riparian area .
so again , this is 2005 .
the ant isn &apos;t alone .
sound healing is a wonderful modality .
and we actually sent this guy materials .
that , i think , is movement .
there &apos;s no american compassion .
maybe the swami is right .

people did not want them .
now think about kids .
transgenesis is really cool too .
what a handsome cat .
even when it &apos;s so hard .
i mean , his farm is incredible .

diplomats are locked in embassy compounds .
and everyone said it was impossible .
these records were human resource forms .
these impacts are coming everyone &apos;s way .

ok , just like mcdonald &apos;s .
there &apos;s a lower chance of rejection .

there &apos;s about 10,000 programs sitting here .
this can be in spirituality .
and what &apos;s the goal now ?
now , you need a laptop .
it is a pain in the arse .
people are starting to figure this out .
pm : i don &apos;t think so .
some of my reporters were arrested .
i offered five cents each for bottle caps .
that person surrounds himself or herself with advisers .
you will go far away .
wow , a volunteer , yay !
we know very little about them .
i wouldn &apos;t have qualified as transgender .
he loved to win .
i also liked the kind of intellectual macho games .
so what is the lesson behind it ?
for example , molecular structure .
and it &apos;s a symmetry we call 6-3-2 .
let me tell you a secret .
when we put these two probes together ...
okay , there it goes . right now .
and you can get a list .
well , beforehand , everything is the same .
or should they not ?
and just one last thing .
he was now dr. carlock in the movie .
and this is an example of this paradigm shift .
my poem is called &quot; dirt . &quot;
and then just leave it all to them .
alright gordon , come on , eh .
we wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere .
tamara , are you recording ?
if only darwin had nasa .
anyone ? it &apos;s much more difficult .
and this leads to very high handling costs .
it was about space and light .
and that &apos;s actually very perverse .
well , you probably recognize the first person .
okay . i do too .
doing the best i can , ok .
and you are noticing it more often .
now there are magazines about water .
they also get entangled in fishing gear .
so how to break that cycle ?
air humidity is up 10 percent .
and every city has its own design .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
what would be your reason ?
he apparently had a sense of humor .
in those fossil rocks are some amazing animals .
how do we combine all this ?
so how do you study rap scientifically ?
this is the restaurant , acorn house .
the idea is embryonic .
they &apos;re not even enjoying the show .
that has nothing to do with it .
why doesn &apos;t that prospect concern you ?
but that only blew out 500 million .
and also you want something that frees your eyes .
and finally the chinese cracked down .
and basically they don &apos;t fear the people .
you see the transducer , the light blue .
i don &apos;t want to make beautiful stuff .
after surgery , everything normalizes .
and there were actually two of these .
so seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane-filtration technology .
they &apos;re at the start of food chains .
and i saw a sign .
so , education is very important .
it &apos;s downtowns becoming ghost towns .
so , this was very inspiring to me .
so we &apos;ve got that incredible ramp-up .
but now for the good news !
that &apos;s what it was like then .
and it &apos;s very difficult to tune .
i want to start though with a paradox .
cities are the crucible of civilization .
that &apos;s what we like , hockey sticks .
and this is just the same .
you see the cells coming back out .
many of those patients are very severely burned .
this is called &quot; atheist . &quot;
change-makers and future leaders have been created .
let &apos;s start with the water .
there &apos;s nothing more vulnerable than that .
rw : do i get to hold them ?
dh : then here we go .
but it is not a normal movie .
what does this mean for medicine ?
the most familiar charge is electric charge .
they have what we want .
we &apos;re down to one and half right now .
so i &apos;ll snap a picture .
so here are some things we learned today .
well , let &apos;s take science .
and it took them four days .
the bubbles are the countries .
some countries still had statistics .
what would an a to z system look like ?
he wasn &apos;t extending his legs appropriately .
it wins or loses at that point .
but how do you go about doing all this scanning ?
some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
i &apos;ve also lived in biosphere 2 .
now maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical .
that &apos;s the devil speaking . &quot;
and the khan academy videos are there .
is this ready for prime time ?
it &apos;s supposed to be attacking what &apos;s attacking the jellyfish .
and we had two types of people .
and 70 percent regained their lives .
that &apos;s the european average for new cars .
the first word that comes up is &quot; doctor . &quot;
i &apos;ll go through a little of them . bolotnitsa .
&quot; ten milligram , 20 milligram . &quot;
i &apos;ll come back to that later .
would that give me a little more freedom ?
and reading is just about impossible .
so , the challenge is full speed ahead .
scott &apos;s results were full of them .
and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
supposedly , anyway . i believe that one .
take the travel service nextpedition .
let me demonstrate this over here .
which one is kiki and which one is buba ?
&quot; a frame &quot; represents a hut in the woods .
is he looking for where the sound came from ?
at least that &apos;s what it says on my pen . &quot;
everyone is just a little bit mad .
he was the most respected scientist in the field .
we will watch children starve to death on tv .
the background to one is the other .
but tesla &apos;s success didn &apos;t last .
it uses a pressure-sensitive adhesive to do it .
so fear showed up as not really the driver .
what makes life easier , more enjoyable ?
he &apos;s a spanish architect and designer .
and dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally .
so freight costs aren &apos;t our biggest problem .
look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
all of system d really doesn &apos;t pay taxes , right ?
and the hormone igf-1 promotes growth .
we &apos;ll look at sea level rise .
he finds it . amazing . right ?
now there &apos;s often no right or wrong here .
2010 new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of storytellers .
we opened the fist section in 2009 .
robert hammond : building a park in the sky
gandhi , too , was a real flawed human being .
that &apos;s what he prays .
she came to this country in 1986 from vietnam .
so amy , would you please come up ?
we have eight engines in this vehicle .
you &apos;re being constrained by the public &apos;s opinion .
so one of these will happen to all of us .
this wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
that &apos;s a transformation , two different things .
there is sub-surface ice on that planet .
it &apos;s baleen . moving on .
and the same is true for the troops .
rory , you mentioned libya at the end .
and bell then goes on to explain to the students .
in this case , we tested it .
and it wasn &apos;t solved until 1655 .
however , there &apos;s a catch .
so , for example , there is the character of noora .
because therein lies the mystery of eroticism .
other places around the country had similar rooms .
these are played mainly in small rooms .
so the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections .
about 300 of them were there .
or he was what he claimed to be .
i have a small lab .
but there will also be large fluctuations .
i had never used a computer .
i &apos;m going to give a fast example here .
now let &apos;s see if mark avoids it .
stromatolites are the heroes in my story .
some mammals turned back to water .
she works with people like murali krishna .
your interest is compared to what ?
natalie merchant : singing old poems to life
and you can &apos;t get more alien than the dolphin .
and we saw this guy , haibao .
and then you ask , why economists ?
solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though .
manhattan no longer spreads its infinity .
each cylinder is a parfait of time .
but it is going to happen in this century .
i know theater unites us .
hundreds of verbs can go both ways .
this is sandia national labs .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
and now they &apos;re all in here .
so dai manju basically finished out middle school .
there &apos;s bill easterly &apos;s book .
what that was was a bird feeder .
before that time , people are left to their own devices .
here is a three-week-old baby .
and there i met francis crick .
but there was ones in the literature .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
and part of that activity is honesty .
i know you understand that .
don &apos;t forget to subtract the one .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
boy : the world peace game is serious .
it &apos;s like its own little coupling .
he wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
we can &apos;t sit idly by here either .
well , i put on my backpack again .
i was born and raised in north korea .
what is the future of the human race ?
okay , so we &apos;re interested in these sorts of things .
a very important environmental lesson could be learned from this .
i &apos;d say it was a pretty good idea .
we &apos;re not even slowing down .
and all we &apos;ve got is a roomba .
and that &apos;s that middle set of bars .
they &apos;re unique facets of the human imagination .
there are two ways of thinking about this .
it &apos;ll only get it wrong one percent of the time .
you have facebook , we have renren .
you &apos;ve got to keep going .
another major revolution : the communications revolution .
this is stephen hawking &apos;s universe .
and then you want to give me a quick business overview .
i had a fire nine days ago .
you know -- all the stuff .
now this is a fanciful theory .
let &apos;s have the next video .
and , interestingly , complexity is very highly evolved .
we &apos;ve heard from bill gates recently .
have you started to do that ?
are you reading an interview by an author ?
this guy specializes in pit vipers .
hopefully it won &apos;t stutter .
who could sleep that night ?
all the young people , actually , from the city .
this one disguises itself as floating algae .
they could slow down by about 50 percent .
this group uses three , one each .
so , i &apos;m just going to grab a chair here .
would they surprise us ? would they intrigue us ?
now that is called the huf haus .
because you don &apos;t need the get-to-know-you session at that point .
i don &apos;t need to go into that .
all the power comes from the sun .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
she jumped out of that car . &quot;
so , what is the social result of this ?
dr : it was an honor to do .
after all , aging is not a piece of cake .
lg : but you see the hand .
ace of diamonds , yes ? zoe : yeah .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m responsible . &quot;
it should be more like private accounting .
if you &apos;re laughing , you know what i mean .
but such a teacher is seldom found .
the students go into a kind of trance .
but that lag is exactly what is expected .
the brain isn &apos;t divided into compartments .
but there &apos;s a middle ground , too .
i &apos;m going to show you our latest dataset .
you just don &apos;t hear that every day .
the creek had been culverted under the parking lot .
as i said , he swore too much .
and you can just imagine them .
so we came up with these two rules .
finding the state of preservation .
so what made these courses so different ?
obviously , we don &apos;t want one of those .
so again , radical versus conservative .
it &apos;s much like on a jet .
it &apos;s like a hangover from protein .
ludwick marishane : a bath without water
ok ? stop . all right , now .
i was faster but just as depressed .
he made sure that everything lined up .
and eventually snow made a map of the outbreak .
they are dying of sadness . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
they have hotlines and spreadsheets and data .
those green things in the foreground are mangoes .
so , this is sort of a complication i &apos;ve found .
but it &apos;s not just the developed nations .
naturally 7 : a full-band beatbox
somewhere down the road we opened a media management center .
he &apos;d ransacked , desecrated the temple .
you all know what happened .
two groups of mujahideen started fighting .
it &apos;s a terrific studio assistant .
how would you make a single flap ?
and this was very disheartening for them .
certainly many advances , many lives saved .
a blood vessel is made up of two different cell types .
the last 40 years have been extraordinary times .
so i said , okay .
sw : what about a skunk ?
and that will get you very far .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do that ?
there are about 30,000 in use now .
i thought , my career &apos;s over .
she went off , she got a penguin .
paul nicklen : tales of ice-bound wonderlands
now this is a task for you to focus on .
it shoots up and it keeps going up .
but why does anyone have to feel anything ?
they want to get back to slower rhythms .
but one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site .
do i matter , or really exist for you ?
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with my life .
but based on what data ?
the sahara was much bigger then than it is now .
the human genome project , or a mars rover mission .
well that &apos;s at least what one wonderful study predicted .
and i was the product of a working-class community .
so the internet needs addressing and directions .
why ? there is the craigslist rideshare board .
and the world didn &apos;t stop in the 1990s .
so obviously this was a gadget to have .
so we could do that for telephones .
that suggests it &apos;s pretty similar levels of development .
but you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
all the time , you have been given an envelope .
these are why people pray .
and here &apos;s another paper .
it &apos;s the intent to treat curve .
as a result , networks are ideal representations of complex systems .
and we built 500 of these glass beakers .
so we were up on top of our bunk beds .
they were saying , make it stop now .
they &apos;re picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard .
and little moments in my life .
are there moms who &apos;ve raised boys around that table ?
so i &apos;ll ask you another question .
they give badge value to everyday little trivial activities .
we alone are gene machines and meme machines as well .
and you think , is it much of a leap ?
well i guess i have to now .
but we &apos;re not there yet .
they &apos;d have to be available at very competitive rates .
we have to get to a power plant .
we didn &apos;t fly it into the pacific .
and i was a really good dancer .
he &apos;s like , &quot; a day . &quot;
people are ready and respond to the story of food .
this isn &apos;t a second class exercise .
that image was the start of the x-ray technology .
no , i just spit out a tooth .
and then life was fine , dandy .
these are all troubles outside of myself .
you &apos;re off , you &apos;re off . that &apos;s it .
make it go in the other direction .
why do you do what you do ?
and they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time .
the project aim is really quite simple .
so this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really .
well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
we are all different from different perspectives .
now i have beaten a song back into you .
and sure enough , there &apos;s the insect .
i actually smelt someone with some on earlier .
so each building has its own personality .
how do we make stable societies ? longevity .
and surgeons were tradesmen , rather than physicians .
brent lawson : happy to be here .
but where will we get the software ?
and there are a lot of other pressures .
this is fly-by , mariner iv .
b is located on the edge of the network .
and that happens at every peripheral node .
it &apos;s displaced the worker from the technology .
but it was too late for sergio .
you don &apos;t need to shrink the disease .
wk : i wanted to make a windmill .
let &apos;s have a look at the third question .
in fact , it &apos;s not even really sequenced that much .
okay , so the great majority of us .
keep kids out of stores that look like this .
how do we protect it into the future ?
how do you build a better health care system ?
this is from the front .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
let me highlight it for you .
let me show you this .
and this actually represented kind of a sea change to me .
and i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
after winning this prize , my life changed .
he had a pretty low-wage job .
he did after all have a toy gun .
this was bert the turtle .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
my heart was three-and-a-half sizes too big .
but i &apos;m not engaged in doing that .
so this is from a virtual autopsy .
now this is really an interesting project .
and that buys us about a factor of 20 .
we &apos;re getting great talks back from them .
dehumanization of others . de-individuation of self .
and really slowly , slowly , slowly , it happened .
this is me , all of me .
these are stories from 20 , 30 years ago .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
they have literally beat a path to our door .
everybody lost faith in me being able to recover .
let &apos;s hear it . shake . louder .
this is mass general in boston .
so here are some other questions .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
i just found the molecule behind it .
so we , in experiments , have administered testosterone to men .
now my career may last a little longer !
rain . not bad . not bad .
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about this .
i became an artist . o.k. , and started drawing .
that &apos;s all we could do .
cookie monster is very , very bad .
now , another thing is the sensory issues .
six to nine months at the right time of the year .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
and mom was just sitting by the car like this .
so this is where people went astray again .
so , the drill was mounted on this robotic arm .
he &apos;s six foot four . he &apos;s 160 pounds .
and this can happen in the medical domain .
it &apos;s a wonderful waste disposal device .
so we &apos;re caught in a kind of trap .
you can hear the five-year-old mind working .
i painted it directly on top of the man .
can we get self-replicating-type behavior ?
look here . this is the world .
you don &apos;t look like debbie reynolds .
that is coltan extraction , gold mining .
so you can actually change the climate .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
so erez and i wanted to know more about that .
it &apos;s an object for the mind .
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
none of your media got it right .
the second reason is that we killed these things .
we were on the biafran side .
so , water is a very important aspect .
i could show you this animal .
and that number 72 never appears .
some have 5,000 . many have more .
so , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
and there were climbers on that summit ridge .
these are serphas lighting juniper branches .
the third thing is again cities .
toby eccles : invest in social change
many patients like that favor radiation therapy .
and we have better-than-surgery results in breasts .
let &apos;s set it to something else .
well , he compartmentalizes his life .
i would like to show you six minutes .
the dome was a request from the client .
they call it the plan coupe .
can &apos;t we make cleaner burning cooking fuels ?
and these are the briquettes that we made .
so this is a typical menu .
we &apos;re going to start easy . some examples .
so , what is the secret of our success ?
i had to have long conversations with my wife .
people say , &quot; is such and such true ? &quot;
jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor .
marcus : it feeds my mind and my soul .
you &apos;re seeing the tuxedos , the bouquets .
now i &apos;m seeing lots of smirks out there .
and we &apos;re doing this through some case studies .
and that is what linked data is all about .
so this is a corrugated box and its shadow .
what percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment ?
others think it &apos;s too much dietary fat .
now this is not very pleasant and comfortable .
second , it had to be extremely affordable .
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy or your resources .
i was essentially a ghost in the system .
i can vote you off the island .
and he asked a very important question .
and you know what that means , of course .
i would like to introduce you to mr. pringle .
we are becoming a nation of just two classes .
he was out there in parol delivering a baby .
she is really the center of the health care system .
and if we now beat up and down ...
we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
but that &apos;s no longer true .
it reminds me of my college days .
this robot can &apos;t be creepy or uncanny .
but you can see those spikes , and they &apos;re there .
so how did a city like this feed itself ?
utopia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliberately .
how would we write the treaty to do that ?
protester : this is a peaceful march .
and why should anyone care ?
now this looks also like a very good story .
it &apos;s about having food .
i don &apos;t want to depress you too much .
positively amazing . here &apos;s two males fighting .
and it &apos;s a tremendous problem for us .
this is some life-support equipment closed-cycle .
ok , this isn &apos;t exactly hardball . ok .
now when it comes to taxes , there is more disagreement .
none of these major theories have been completely successful .
the fear is that the world is watching .
i &apos;m watching your faces very carefully .
after they sporulate , they do rot .
i was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way .
and that is what medicine can feel like sometimes .
she doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being filmed .
and we can predict what the sound will be .
this is shifting and reflecting functions .
there &apos;s something small there that responds .
one way around this is to draw pictures .
the color represents different rooms they are in the house .
so what i did was i made an adventure strip .
let me explain what that is .
alisa miller : the news about the news
by raking it off the backs of their suffering people .
it meant something that would connect us all together .
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?
i don &apos;t try to design the toothbrush .
something like that . i am not sure of that .
they said , &quot; it &apos;s good enough for government work .
it looks like a hair dryer from mars .
i said , &quot; he passed away a long time ago .
roz savage : why i &apos;m rowing across the pacific
infinity . you all got it right . exactly .
which way will these fall ?
why would you want to shut me down or turn me off ?
getting over our fear of riding bikes . making our beds .
well , we &apos;re all equally sophisticated .
you can see that it got started right here .
even the parts of the airplane had french names .
remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost .
irrigation is the biggest use of water on the planet .
and we interact with the physical world with our hands .
this is jesse , and he &apos;s squeezing a foam toy .
and they share a lengthy land border .
they all have heroes who were chosen .
it &apos;s not enough to simply write people off .
but compassion , from my vantage point , has a problem .
right , the famous chinese character for picnic area .
we learn these really bad lessons really well .
other people who are poor don &apos;t have those choices .
and they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary .
you just have to feed me . &quot;
everything in its place . first stage .
so that gives you a little taste of that piece .
it tanked . no one ever bought it .
i mean , a no hands , no toilet paper toilet .
and here is the fruition of that in actuality .
one such project is about a year and a half old .
very funny people , if that &apos;s what lol means .
instead , there was a litany of astonishing optimism .
we should stop looking outside .
this is juan carlos , king of spain .
almost every year we have these landslides , which are terrible .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going through at this time .
and the regular astronomers were scornful about this .
carl schoonover : how to look inside the brain
so let &apos;s cut to the chase .
and db will probably roll toward you .
i just do that to make money .
ue : nope . it &apos;s just smoke .
vint cerf : ng : speaking as one .
we become what we really are interested in .
you can just make it physically on the spot .
happy to take your questions .
so please join me for a minute of silence .
so you don &apos;t want me to street juggle here , right ?
he had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned .
let &apos;s hope it &apos;s really stable .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
another keystone species is a famous animal called the european aurochs .
the passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome .
de-extinction falls in that category .
it makes it adversarial . it &apos;s polarizing .
sensing and responding : feedback is a huge thing .
and all around the world are not exceptions .
and that &apos;s actually where our story begins .
i don &apos;t know any tedtalk that contains this .
so , this is important for imitation and emulation .
and there are fascinating dynamics at play .
and surprisingly , it became a cult film .
but we did get an agreement on climate change .
my father , a secret agent ?
they are trying to multiply , i think .
we destroyed two pianos and 10 televisions in the process .
but now let &apos;s look at the other end .
now i wasn &apos;t trying to be smart .
they were willing to pay extra in order to wait .
jobs for whom ? especially jobs for young men .
this is the skyline of my hometown , new orleans .
they jump high . they wear red .
then you look at the phenomenon of kogi .
literature has to take us beyond .
and i even felt a sense of shame because of that .
previous generations couldn &apos;t do this experiment at all .
and i think this isn &apos;t 1,000 years out .
and that turned right away into another project .
and of course , this is what the tibetan monks told us .
first you trap atoms in a special bottle .
so now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt .
peter van uhm : why i chose a gun
they both empower our promise and our peril .
statistically , one of you is a beetle .
there &apos;ll be huge professional arguments as well .
this was just a few days ago in agumbe .
so we aborted using motion capture .
so i &apos;m going to show you another film .
and i have to say , thank god .
okay . right to left , how many ? okay .
and we &apos;re seeing a steady increase among males .
usually it &apos;s one or two a year .
and we cogitated about this for about four years .
your robe gives it away . &quot;
i &apos;m not exactly comfortable with emotions .
and &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
so this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .
orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station .
are you going to come and drag me off ?
the birds were able to jump from one to the other .
so let me talk about hydrogen first .
because you all used to be three years old .
let &apos;s see what happens here .
but it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level .
we need to combine this with the scientific method .
we let that lie around in the sun .
wait , wait , wait -- please take any card .
do it because you like to do it .
the aluminum is because it &apos;s very light .
dan pallotta : the way we think about charity is dead wrong
so kleiber is about process .
there will be stronger storms and greater flooding .
let &apos;s just say &quot; value for money . &quot;
it &apos;s by a guy named daniel merlin goodbrey in britain .
you could do the whole thing with addition .
the input and the output was by teletype tape at first .
they want to be self -- they want to self-police themselves .
and we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
and he was hanging out with all us younger guys .
this can sometimes have unintended consequences . ok .
and i feel now like george bush .
the result , of course , is that we get stressed .
it did not happen overnight .
human relationships are rich and they &apos;re messy and they &apos;re demanding .
my name is joseph , a member of parliament in kenya .
that &apos;s my baby reina . thank you .
it is just a large primate brain .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
he was a new man , taller again .
and you should see me during the match .
and that hospital could have afforded flashlights .

the one on the left is an x-ray .
that realization is extraordinarily corrosive , extraordinarily corrupting .
we think liars won &apos;t look you in the eyes .

miranda wang : we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
as an architect , i have to confront something like this .

you will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic .
and let &apos;s explore this notion of simplicity .
i &apos;ll give you one more example for this .
and so , and that windmill , what -- it worked ?
so what have we learned from all this ?
and , of course , they &apos;re basically extinct now .
no one &apos;s listening . no one &apos;s trusting .
they work in government offices . they &apos;re drivers .
we did it . he provided us dust monitors .
now , you may ask about these kids .
it &apos;s not possible -- it doesn &apos;t work .
you &apos;re going to be okay . you &apos;re going to live .
i led three diving expeditions to antarctica .

and mom and dad ? never been up .
that &apos;s my studio . it &apos;s subterranean .
and yet , you yourself defy all those characterizations .
it &apos;s absolutely heartbreaking to see .
the retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here .
so , now we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
so this is the dawn of the new age of kites .
well , you can &apos;t compare oranges to windshields .
alrighty , everybody , have a great weekend .
that &apos;s where babies were born and people died .
the office building is basically obsolete for doing private work .
sometimes you get very , very severe queues .
but this our containment of the visible universe .
there is first , the present self .
in this case , you &apos;re seeing oxygen bubbles come out .
it is human nature to look away from illness .
it foamed , and horrible things were happening to me .
first of all , worse nutrition , maybe shorter life spans .
also , don &apos;t delete what you &apos;ve highlighted .
these aren &apos;t financial stats ; this is culture .
you can take it really , really far .
but that alone doesn &apos;t give us the road map .
so what can scientists learn about this data ?
kb : how many times did you feel it ?
that &apos;s an adult orinoco crocodile in its jaws .
thank you very much and enjoy the conference .
jonathan klein : photos that changed the world
hey , hey black-eyed susie , hey .

&quot; and now it &apos;s got a hangover . &quot;
thank you for joining us today .
then his main competitor went out and broke his record .

give us tools . give the farmers tools .
well , it was basically frustration .
they said , &quot; of course .
and , indeed , they &apos;re becoming a very powerful force .
i felt just something &apos;s broken .
that &apos;s pretty high for most occupations .
and the last thing , i bring back this nudibranch .
so this particular device is called the gut listener .
so what &apos;s image got do with it ?

we want to be with you and across from you .
nice show . man , that was good !
bf : also three with his left .

testing in humans is around the corner .
and guess what ? we won it hands down .
we all know the earth is in trouble .
i did something that nobody else had done .
we needed to know , is life this malleable ?
but it &apos;s pit crews that we need , pit crews for patients .
and that is the spell that i want to break .
that is what we have done on this planet .
look what it has in the middle of it .
now our sun will not collapse to a black hole .
but i was excited , so i kept going .
so i believe this kept me running .
there were only two other dannys on the internet then .
it &apos;s time for me to let it go .
so what does play do for the brain ?
that &apos;s all the u.s. usage today .
traditionally , africans hate governments . they hate tyranny .
there are lots of people who actually share the same dream .
then there was aron kader , who was the palestinian-american .
i &apos;m like , &quot; what are you doing here ? &quot;
there &apos;s the world trade center site , on the front cover .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
they were able to create that .
martin rees : is this our final century ?
here on the model you see the predator attacking .
or you can pull them up where you want them .

jenna mccarthy : what you don &apos;t know about marriage
and this is a picture of my graduation team from legacy .
there was no new data , but there was less fear .
they had good relationships with the teachers , students .
we automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward .
and it is a most edifying form of instant gratification .
so that &apos;s one out of every two or three people you know .
i started it with one other family in 1980 .
and suddenly he knows he &apos;s been defeated .
in terms of the political changes , they have introduced village elections .
there is a lot more work we need to do with this .
there are more pictures . there are more photographers .
the inventors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
it was like , 160 dollars for this ?
this is absolutely crucial , and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this .
the architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb .
so we can think more about things like street grids .
some people call us debunkers , which is kind of a negative term .

the list of candidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500 .
pm : that &apos;s dimitri at his most competitive .
she has become part of the solution , not the problem .

so we said , &quot; let &apos;s look at these . &quot;
we weren &apos;t the best chemists in the room .
&quot; why not ? &quot; the girls asked .
the reality of polio today is something very different .
that &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem we have to solve .
so people would have a real grand mal seizure .
by 18 and 19 , i was sleeping through the night .
you would recoil . you would call the police .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
and our little life is rounded with a sleep .
so , blue , blue , everything became blue .
that one &apos;s pretty good . it &apos;s getting better .
you might think of that as the privatization of war .
would you deserve to be killed ?
what we do is make a very simple electric motor .
what i was trying to get at here was as a smileygirl1978 .
our creativity comes from without , not from within .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later ?
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about ptsd .
they said , &quot; can we do an advertising campaign ?
we &apos;re going to test them out . they &apos;ll probably all fail .
china plans to be there in just 20 years .
so everyone of you turns to their neighbor please .
the smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives , worldwide .
girl : well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
in many countries it is a different story .
my soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace .
so let &apos;s play a 550-herz frequency and watch what happens .
even if the competition is the old way of doing something .
i didn &apos;t know that ; that &apos;s pretty cool .
we have a serious meme running through .
and he comes to the town . he &apos;s a broken person .
and , of course , they are cruel and ruthless toward others .
here &apos;s the increase in less than a decade .
and it shows you how robust the control is .
and it does that avoiding obstacles .
and what do we do ? how do we respond to this ?
this is based on an f. scott fitzgerald short story .
and we found this right in this very state , in karnataka .
that this is not a good test for her .
and this , over the years , can cause real damage , cardiovascular damage .
a.j. jacobs : how healthy living nearly killed me
i think none of these is the problem .
okay . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
those are the things that are going to happen first .
the price to pay , however , is leaving the garden .
that is what the unconscious mind hungers for .
this was -- my motivation was actually during apollo .
here , on the west coast , you &apos;ve destroyed your forest .
you leave aside what is natural to be natural .
where can i go today and who can i do it with ?
and they got here in the late 1960s .
he was told that a cure did not exist .
but the visual complexity is still very high .
now , headline writers had a field day with our studies .
it &apos;s called &quot; are you smarter than a fifth grader ? &quot;
another suit . lg : diamonds , perfect .
i see some of you recognize this child .
so let &apos;s see what &apos;s really going on here .
we also believe that it &apos;s the content that is more important .
this was his horseradish . he was obsessed with it !
howard doesn &apos;t believe that there is such a thing .
a mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning .
that &apos;s what it was . and why were we attached to that ?
this song is called &quot; farther than the sun . &quot;
if you can cook , time doesn &apos;t matter .
this is a new work , it &apos;s a new program .
evgeny morozov : how the net aids dictatorships
i learned that success isn &apos;t a one-way street .
and the soprano section is just full of hot girls . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s because dad used to read to us at night .
and it was set in a wider watery ooze .
the societal challenges that come along with that kind of inequality deserve some attention .
our bodies have adapted to these new diets .
he &apos;s evangelical about it . he brings his cousins in now .
this challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization .
no . so i had to think a little harder .
now , some people call that a theory of everything .
it &apos;s about your constituencies ; it &apos;s about your businesses .
and i feel like i &apos;ve just got started .
if we had a slide of salisbury steak , even more so , right ?
she kept getting distracted . he eventually won the race .
in summer , you might as well be at the equator .
every problem that &apos;s out there , somebody has the idea for .
i sold license plate protectors door to door .
and the hospital and ge were happy too .
i survived , just so you know .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
this time i said let &apos;s try something different .
it would be very dangerous if you fell down .
my parents found it necessary for peace of mind .
goliath is a sitting duck . he doesn &apos;t have a chance .
and we have over 40 irc channels , 40 mailing lists .
yr : actually , i try to stay just fit .
but it was too stoney and full of cactus on top .
like i said , it shapes your reality .
we get to exercise some ancient , ancient drives .
and she puts it in her friend &apos;s coffee .
and in the summer india heats up , gets very hot .
so , next thing i did is i got on the phone .
i last did a tedtalk i think about seven years ago or so .
and imagine copying that by hand .
you &apos;ll be familiar with the double helix of dna .
and in the last 200 years , something else has happened .
knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom .
how do the media talk about schools and teachers ?
&quot; the government needs to provide economically viable services . &quot;
in uganda we see the prevalence went down .
and those bumps act like a magnet for water .
so right now the web is partitioned into multiple languages .
i was playing the violent african , the african terrorist .
you want to be rich , you be a businessman .
because can you imagine everything boiling ?
what makes you feel vulnerable ? &quot;
we said , &quot; could you build this ? &quot;
and it has implications for systemic risk .
he was the first digital media producer in tokyo .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going to lead us .
okay . what is fusion ? here comes the nuclear physics .
i promise she read that text .
the flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet .
and this is a cafe by the sea in britain .
well , the other hot button is parenting .
i don &apos;t like what i &apos;m thinking right now . &quot;
but how do you sit in a sane way ?
now -- but that &apos;s not the whole story .
each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size .
would there be time to be able to work with it ?
it &apos;s very , very epic and a very beautiful concert .
so you have to be careful with hacker .
and immediately a voice shouted , &quot; kangaroo ! &quot;
what ever happened to the small hadron collider ?
you should turn it into mcdonald &apos;s .
then i went to run 50k , then 60k .

i gave them the plotline of madame bovary .
my breath is down to three breaths a minute .
it &apos;s the only swim i &apos;m interested in .
a lot of you have gotten that phillips direct life .
they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments .
mw : okay . well , it was partially my fault .
but let me show you cutting-edge robotics .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older and older .
evangelicals have joined it . jewish groups have joined it .
this is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain .
we see a transformation in attendance by girls .
it would take 2,000 or 3,000 bombs .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior .
and one thing that is common to all of life is dna .
it &apos;s not really all that much data .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
i &apos;m going to skip way ahead here to the space phase .
and in my game , that means you overgesticulate .
this pig at 10 : 06 was having a heart attack .
so it &apos;s sort of an electronic book .
what &apos;s extraordinary is how simple the premise is .
the first is the fall of granada , the last muslim enclave in europe .
and this is one of my favorites , al-batina from yemen .
&quot; so when &apos;s the article coming out ? &quot;
and this is how we look for them .
and what happens when the teacher tries to assert order ?
it &apos;s profitable to have an unsafe working environment .
and it definitely does give a different image of yemen .
why should we believe what he &apos;s saying ? &quot;
that power disappears completely ; nobody supports that by 2011 .
the ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule .
and in 2001 , i took a research leave to visit them .
but the desire element is really dialed way up .
here , let me introduce you to sam haber .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s actually happening right now .
these kinds of probes exploit it . okay ?
there are three ways . the main way is -- it &apos;s called dispositional .
and i ended the study the next day .
there is just one reference point , which is the body .
and temporarily , very unexpectedly , they dropped .
and i went on a run that i know so well .
and this is not a difficult problem to fix .
and i &apos;ll show you some of these tools right here .
and we never think about the hidden connection .
we &apos;ve got a problem with the antenna ringing .
until i tell you who said it .
we need someone to come and study it .
there was a reason for that ; it was me .
and he took me up to the temples in nikko .
not only has that been weak. it &apos;s getting weaker .
and this here is the infamous nsa data center in utah .
i want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought they did .
absurd . but i had to follow the victorian norm .
i think that &apos;s what all this is pointing at .
he would have the sound coming through the resonators .
well , there were two satellites which were particularly interesting .
and only from the air did i see the big picture .
you can see these horrifying figures from africa .
now , am i saying , &quot; oh , well , great prevention strategy .
in fact , it could save countless lives .
and now he &apos;s going to do what darpa asked me for .
&quot; guys , and woman , you &apos;ve given enough .
and it was astounding how positive they are .
and there is no way to slow my heart rate down .
congratulations . you have now completed setup .
these are really hybrids , not pure animals .
well , you measure and measure and measure .
and now i have income per person on this axis .
public administration , which is largely patronage , takes 690 billion .
it has also some beautiful primates .
electricity was also very helpful in liberating women .
these guys make the loudest car stereo in the world .
manchester craftsmen &apos;s guild is named after my neighborhood .
and so he &apos;s assembled a group of people .
or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them .
i &apos;m saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough .
so we thought , let &apos;s give it a go .
and many times i don &apos;t see africans working with them .
we have ibukun awosika in nigeria , with the chair company .
i &apos;m going to try to condense this for you .

allison hunt : my three minutes hasn &apos;t started yet , has it ?
right . so , that &apos;s how the device is used .
john , thank you for making science-fiction real .
so by and large , they are good for our survival .
we don &apos;t need no more trouble get that idiot out !
but in the meantime , these things are scaling up .
there are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit .
it means that it &apos;s in the low 60 percent .
maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt ?
in the second world war , we needed to produce a lot of stuff .
well , you have pizza when you &apos;re hungry for pizza .
they came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal .
well i think you probably already have the picture .
this stuff is really important . this stuff is really vital . &quot;
we basically gave children a very simple challenge .
they don &apos;t want second-standard , second-quality outputs .
almost everything we do is subconscious .
they thought some people didn &apos;t like them .
we &apos;ve heard about the japanese giving up guns .
but , encouragingly , i &apos;ve seen just the opposite .
you grow fast and then stop -- part of our resilience .
rebecca mackinnon : let &apos;s take back the internet !
let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now .
there was professor tobias . he &apos;s come over .
one -- i want to speak as early in the morning as possible .
online drawing tools -- you &apos;ve probably seen a lot of them .
they &apos;ve been in use , in architecture , since ancient times .
for years , the country has been divided between politics and religion .
they tell us what interactions are allowed to happen .
right ? i mean , somebody &apos;s seen him .
so we started a separate line of research doing driver state modeling .
we had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane .
i showered in campgrounds . i ate out regularly .
those are the things to be provided by the business community .
we can try . we &apos;ll try . maybe we &apos;ll try .
one of the zones next to hong kong has a city called shenzhen .
let me just close with ethical and policy studies .
you break out that leviathan force only every so often .
and we &apos;re able to look out for the needs of newcomers .
i don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
it &apos;s also an idea that we have forgotten .
and we get about two or three bands a day signing up .
this is in fact , this beautiful photograph , is in fact over the amazon .
but it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
she said , &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot;
there is none of this quality of being addressed with these charles bonnet hallucinations .
so again , this is all derived accurately from the science .
keep your eyes lifted and your head turning .
and people always say , &quot; why do that ?
but they &apos;re also going to ask you probably a different question .
as a matter of fact , we added to the contract .
now all you need is about 10 percent of the electricity generated .
there are certain things that we need to recognize .

they &apos;re producing things for between 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
for the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
but we can do this , and there are opportunities to make this work .
so , what am i talking about when i talk about system d ?
that &apos;s the cheese , just to show you .
this is libby , or actually , this is an ultrasound image of libby .
when that ice melts , sea level rises by six meters .
so , we have two panels here , of colored dots .
think of cancer , of bird flu , swine flu , sars .
and groups are very often immediately label terrorists .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
so we &apos;re actually measuring each isotope as a different one .
because it is in stage three that many of us move .
okay , number two : go to the wilderness .
bl : all right . one , two , three .
they fall apart , they disintegrate , and they end up here .
only months later , i discover who he really was .
the evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
what we really wanted was a full human body .
but actually , i believe there are really two microsofts .
forgeries were painted over it , and it suffered very badly from mold .
these are the images that are automatically constructed .

it was the future i couldn &apos;t accept .
yves behar : designing objects that tell stories
maybe some things are bad traditions and they need to be changed .
but they &apos;re also very high pressure , so they &apos;re dangerous .
we blow it up and look at the pieces .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re seeing increasingly this demand for access to information .
they &apos;re not magic . they are not our parents .
you have to trust me . take it on faith . &quot;
he had an enormous amount of love , he loved everybody .
now , a bit of economic history , i think , may be helpful here .
now all of this has been tremendous for the world .
we need to settle down before we wreck the planet .
e.o. wilson : my wish : build the encyclopedia of life
so , this is an emotional topic . some people stand .
what did you gain cognitively from convincing me ?
and they actually shipped them here to texas for us .
and finally , my son playing in a walking toy by himself .
this is the first house i built .

farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees .
well , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement up there .
after watching eight tedtalks , he wants to become leonardo da vinci .
i &apos;ve clearly got mass . where does it come from ?
she took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting .
so it hasn &apos;t just been the spread of cognitively demanding professions .
it &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot;
so wolfram alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things .
sometimes , i found small jobs in exchange for food .
we need to work locally , but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide .
we need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect .
it &apos;s far higher than the failure rate of , say , americans .
what i &apos;m saying is our approach is simply unsustainable .
and it makes anything possible , makes anything rationalizable .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- it &apos;s a courthouse .
it &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
but i am against using it as a barrier .
but they couldn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
take astronomy as an example , which yochai has already mentioned .
this is a very , very , very early test in our process .
now we also study more complex expressions . this is consolation .
and i think a lot of scientists have this attitude .
space , we all know what it looks like .
let &apos;s slow it down and you can see the spines in action .
and there &apos;s some guy watching a hundred , obviously .
working with space and the lines in space in a different way .
suddenly , in the mid-40s , there started to be a buzz .
but guess what , nobody will really care .
and i &apos;d be , like , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
what it is is intelligence is defined by prediction .
instead of jamming the gps signals , you fake them .
we &apos;re not going to get enough energy from renewables alone .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .

they are mulling whether they &apos;re going to take it further .
let &apos;s start with how i got to this point .
if so , more warming is in the pipeline .
a large fraction of species will be committed to extinction .
i know when i &apos;m licked . &quot;
and i suspect , by someone who actively dislikes us .
many other ecosystems on earth are in real , real danger .
we don &apos;t want to get caught flat-footed again .
and i therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward .
and then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size .
and here , if you watch , you can see the terminus retreating .
somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here .
very , very convenient solution to that particular problem .
and this area of the ecuadorian amazon -- oil was discovered in 1972 .
i discovered that cheetos are good , expressive material .
the rca is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint .
so fueled by that ambition , he returned to the state legislature .
so i asked him , &quot; what is that ? &quot;
and that &apos;s the kind of information they &apos;re going to bring back to you ?
so it runs frequently , the entire hospital , just on a generator .
jh : is there a relief in playing with these forces ?
so i think , conceivably , those could be predictive .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to go to an mba program .
you have a mind . and you have other people .
and i wonder how often that happens .
something we have in gando are clay pots .
i took more photos , and we started the project .
but they asked me for a promise basically .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
and i sat like you guys there in the audience .
i started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind .

and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but just ...
it was advocating friends and a doting sister .
the other group gets two apples , one is taken away .
we create stories to define our existence .
but that cannot account for the mass either .
embedding nanoparticles in a material for instance , always .
secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in india .
building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do .
so , so i &apos;ve got something else that &apos;s not personal .
in fact , we have such amazing lifeforms that we can manipulate .

i set up a climate change ngo called the climate group .
a solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years .
about 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people , under 30 years old .
science has surfaced many , many more indicators .
so that &apos;s why i took a bit of time to study coke .

this turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans .
what we saw up till now was from the pacific .
students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .

i talked about the large , complicated robot .
and we don &apos;t even need to confine ourselves to this macro vision .
the oldest rock on earth is only 3.6 billion .
it was getting more and more apparent that we &apos;re fighting a losing battle .
and one of the journalists said to her , what &apos;s up ?
we need deep-diving subs , new technologies to explore the ocean .
in fact in medical terms , that &apos;s our view .

stephen ritz : a teacher growing green in the south bronx
how do you decide what is important ?

it &apos;s crazy , really , when you think about it .
and let &apos;s cut the crap for a second .
nadia al-sakkaf : well , i &apos;m glad to be here .
for example , let &apos;s go with the centipede virus first .

and he said , &quot; so what are you going to do to celebrate ? &quot;
the average answer , or the modal answer would have been 50 to 60 percent .
in this mode , he &apos;s trying to maintain his position .
and so we have set about doing that .
so this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments .
you flip a switch and there is electric light .

my hand is at life , here , so -- at risk .
i was planning on finishing on a dance ...

the elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks .
i should tell you what &apos;s happened with these experiments .

so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other .
so this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin .
so then , what do we do about that ?
i &apos;ve got metal and earth to come .
they cover the earth , except for antarctica .
so i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas .
a child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
they had four good friends of a person judge their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
so the government decided to have the elections once again .
as we &apos;ve seen here , we &apos;re transforming ourselves into cyborgs .
ok , now let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
britain , america , japan , south africa , the congo .
half of her body was stricken , the other half not .
&quot; congratulations on your upcoming nuptials , james .
and i think this is really the theme of this session .
it &apos;s a cd basically . it &apos;s a compact disc .
and one day i had a -- oh , well , the other way .
so , magnificent creature , isn &apos;t it ?
there are no little tanks where we &apos;re making surgeons .
when you do , what do you want to control ?
now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
but i think we can do both at the same time here .
it &apos;s value created by the participants for each other .
could you have imagined that day would come ?
why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery ?
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket ?
well , by and large people are enormously impatient .
watch what happens when we drop some out .
and as a result , many people look at economists as stupid people .
she &apos;s waiting for the market to open a little impatiently .
well , in those documents , there are little squares , little boxes .
and that fascinated me , to explore that territory .
it anticipated change , even though those changes were not known .
because of some of technologies we &apos;ve been talking about .
so i time-stamp my life every few moments .
it &apos;s being safe in the world .
and by the evening of that day , 70 children were all browsing .
and i went through it . i went through those mobs .
and you say , &quot; hey , could you bring the skim milk ? &quot;
and you can actually -- -- we won &apos;t get into that .
and i &apos;ll show you the 15 million dollar picture .
these are the basic features of my device , or our device .
as an absolute connection , it only works one way .
and then again , there is the fact that we are streamlined .
yeah , i was hanging out with some google guys last night .
different parts of the world have a knack for different things .
blogging is one way of doing that .
i &apos;m just going to sell these to every clinic in the world .
for example , we can augment digital content with physical mass .
wouldn &apos;t that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive ?
now , you may have noticed more and more headlines like these .
dh : all right , please stand here in front ...
dh : just do it juggler boys , you say ?
this is actually from one of -- the paper that she translated .
it &apos;s considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics .
okay . lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world .
allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame .
of course it pays , if you like marshmallows , to wait .
and like the rest of the brain , it &apos;s made of neurons .
and that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells .
and we chose to use the prescription for that purpose .
there &apos;s a fish with glowing eyes , pulsating eyes .
we are ready to spend 15 years achieving education .
it &apos;s a place worth caring about . it &apos;s well defined .
the ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep .
no , i just want to live life to its full .
now why does that matter for human health ?
whenever they have a moment they chat to each other .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . there they are , folks .
i &apos;ve had to move that part across , but only a millimeter .
and i think we need to get back to that sermon tradition .
exactly what loaning means , i &apos;m not quite sure .
the designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant , unbelievably brilliant .
that actually occurred this year . she took early retirement .
so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct .
you gotta be accurate ! there &apos;s measurement involved , increments .
it could definitely be done by people in this room .
he never seems to settle on any particular girl .
my job description was deliciously vague : wilderness assessment and public relations .
good . then i shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable .
ok , oh , ok -- you have a 10-digit calculator , sir , as well ?
if you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 343 .
and in this project we &apos;ve developed a form of intelligent real-time subtitles .
so we &apos;re bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics .
you think the a.u. will put together a conference like this ?
even when the japanese bombed pearl harbor , at least they shot back .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
so i went down to the lobby , and i saw this indian guy .
it doesn &apos;t see any excess cost . it doesn &apos;t spend any extra time .
and euclid said , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ?
and then we asked them how happy they are again .
lawrence lessig : we the people , and the republic we must reclaim
you should care about your posture -- this is not right .
any lady , any lady ? thank you very much .
i love that i do not take things lightly .
we &apos;ll set a few rules and we &apos;ll stick to them .
you do not need to have the education level of people in this room .
we spoke to you last several years ago .
surprised by my insistence , the waiter took up the issue with the manager .
yet that is exactly what the american paradigm demands .
he said she had one of the new , better chairs .
so , our cell phones can now build a place history .
we &apos;re using a biological amplifier to amplify these nerve signals -- muscles .
so they have all the criteria that people normally like .
so how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging ?
it &apos;s like trying to run into a brick wall .
they don &apos;t stick by velcro or suction or glue .
but then at the very end is where we have the instrumental record in black .
and it was found close to here , stanford .
there was no road map . no one had ever done anything like this before .
in fact , martin luther king &apos;s most famous line was at stage three .
so i &apos;m going to sit here in my chair and not do anything . &quot;
i can &apos;t quite explain it , and he can &apos;t either .
so that &apos;s the world we &apos;re living in today .
we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity .
i mean , people are worried about cellphones being safe .
so , to make a long story short , they came to canada .
and i said to the translator , &quot; what did he say ? &quot;
we know that about 106 billion people have ever lived .
spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti-ballistic capabilities .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
so , here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked .
that &apos;s what we thought was going to come out of this .
some of the stories are just so classic , and yet so understandable .
i &apos;m ellen , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with food .
it &apos;s getting the dead to talk back that &apos;s the really hard part .
i will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
with tears in my eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
drive home for dinner with my wife and kids .
we &apos;ve completed now clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
and why only computers ? we can just play with papers .
this is going to be the third largest park in rio by june this year .
what did i do ? did i follow my gut ?
well that &apos;s interesting . that &apos;s a different way of thinking .
but even more incredible was the footage shot from the triton submersible .
because it &apos;s working , put me in a poster now .
this is not the israel-loves-iran . this is not my page .
was the internet actually a place that you could visit ?
it &apos;s created depositing layers of about four microns .
the good news is that it doesn &apos;t have to be .
and my first year at caltech , i continued the business .
nk : no , he &apos;s been dead for 25 years .
it can &apos;t just be a giant sexist conspiracy .
and the soldiers are chinese , and everybody else is chinese .

sound affects us physiologically , psychologically , cognitively and behaviorally all the time .
it &apos;s not just the children who are affected , though .
in south korea and indonesia , women own nearly half a million firms .
oh , i &apos;m going to be the johnny appleseed of sound .
my dad was , which is kind of an interesting way to grow up .
he said , &quot; go on , milo . squash it . &quot;
and what you can do is sort of compare dna of normal segs versus cancer .

that &apos;s a much more meaningful combination , a more powerful combination .
we can &apos;t risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats . &quot;
what i &apos;m interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people .
so many of you know that that &apos;s beethoven &apos;s seventh symphony .
i &apos;m not saying that they can &apos;t live a beautiful , wonderful life .
the acoustics of music are much harder than those of language .
and this program takes a shape , spits out 250 dna sequences .
this is a friction climb , up in tuolumne meadows , in the yosemite high country .
and 9 / 11 has a conspiracy theory . it is a conspiracy .
so our next question then was , how are they doing this ?
all right , there &apos;s this episode of &quot; star trek . &quot;
and now they are close as can be .
&quot; safer ? why ? they have posted more policemen here ? &quot;
on street sides all over port-au-prince , entrepreneurs sprung up offering mobile phone charging stations .
by 2015 , there will be three billion smartphones in the world .
take anything you want out of the suitcase .

and they use them in the same way we use our binocular vision .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . do you know that ?
not like computer memory . it &apos;s not at all like computer memory .
well , the computer did , and in fact did so for one out of three subjects .
the oed has 33 different numbered definitions for set .
the reality is that there &apos;s , what , 21 nations that have nuclear power ?
you can see this chip even breathes .
so i was , more or less , classed as &quot; nothing . &quot;
and i bent it &apos; round , and made it into the chariot .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
it looks like a fairly simple thing , but this was a half a million dollar project ?
so yeah , i think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities .
they can adjust and find their comfort they need to find .
teacher turnover is eight times higher than the u.s. national average .
the problem bmw faces is this car looks safe .
that &apos;s just a caveat . that &apos;s different from actually having an effective ad campaign .
which card shall i use ? queen or five ?
and then , king , after exactly five seconds .
these are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses .
now that &apos;s great . what about the eyes ?
and in terms of climate change , is something that is not actually feasible .
but kids , usually they do art for fun . it &apos;s playing .
and the girl said , &quot; they will in a minute . &quot;
so as you can see here , this is a , eleven-inch diameter circuit board .
but interestingly , anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain .
we treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants .
so the sub that was outside last year -- this is the one .
i took her portrait up on top of the jokhang temple .
she was sending them to school . have a new home .
he basically said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
you know the uni is the most challenging , so number ten is challenging .
that was a challenge we had to face as physicists .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- dystonic is how we refer to that .
it was 1908 . that &apos;s fine . i can live with that .
now , why does stuff like that work ? that &apos;s the question .
and obviously he never came down . the statement was never made .
so the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able .
these were the low-tech approaches to the high-tech conversations i was having .
&quot; well yes , we need to increase the production of feet .
can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a great piece of art .
might be more complicated in humans , but perhaps not that much .
but it is a politics of principle , not of partisanship .
now , i know you don &apos;t believe me , really , here .
this is the school , built with the community .
voice : why not ? that &apos;s a very good hand .
there &apos;s cavalry , men on horseback and with chariots .
it &apos;s not a perfect rule , but it &apos;s a nice starting point for quick research .
in the jungles of guatemala , in tikal , stands a temple .
i &apos;ve got a girlfriend who &apos;s just getting over a terrible love affair .
glasses are not very expensive . they &apos;re quite plentiful .

staircases that curve away from you are glamorous .
it takes children a long time to break into the system .
and then i went away for four months and there was going to be groundbreaking .

and he told them , &quot; question the unquestionable .
they agreed , and now i have apps on the app store .
it &apos;s still thermally hot but it &apos;s not radioactive .
so , steven is sharing this story , but he is not alone .
but my brother didn &apos;t . my brother went straight down the line .
and the problem is it &apos;s scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons .
so for example , we &apos;ve created a newspaper , a regular newspaper .
and how much punishment would i get if i get caught ?
but trust me , i work in advertising .
these are the more polite ones i could share with you today .
everyone i showed it was really surprised at this .
a happy song about global warming , from jill sobule .
moving along , what about the area of this figure ?

no one hears you in a stall , you &apos;re just texting quietly .
from the smallest wisp of air to the powerful forces of nature &apos;s storms .
it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals .
but instead of what it is , our focus was on the way it worked .
and i think that the argument can &apos;t be put any more eloquently than that .
&quot; oh , i &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; -- that &apos;s weird .
in fact , the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world .
and we used this technique again during the treasure rescue .
we all look the same inside , believe me .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
it &apos;s too complex and difficult to change .

an msf hospital in a camp for displaced people .
and all the eastern religions except japan had the same level .
because the death of a child is compensated by one more child .

we say &quot; yes , &quot; we shake our heads &quot; no . &quot;
we &apos;re going to try to show you high definition from the pacific .
ok . now let &apos;s move from sleep to diseases .
because that &apos;s part of where we &apos;ve got to get to .
this type of habitat covers more of the earth &apos;s surface than all other habitats combined .
so that really means i have to make predictions of the future .
mars has the largest impact crater in the solar system , hellas basin .
and the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ares .
we fold it , and we transport it in a spacecraft .
and then , just some examples . this stuff really is sculpture .
and maybe most important , they have a big effect on other companies .
don &apos;t let me skip over that . better biofuels are a really big deal .
i &apos;d like to talk about what i call digital food .
it was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down .
how many of each type of tree do you have ? where are they positioned ?
we can look at the fabric . and we can change neurons .
but pulling them back , all of the sudden becomes more complex .
the desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
and we aren &apos;t talking about it -- we dismiss it .
they &apos;ve gone missing ; these feelings have gone missing .
instead , let &apos;s invent to the price point of the electricity market .

we as a world are faced with a problem .
here &apos;s the pacific with large mpas and large conservation zones on it .
rughal : there must be something we can do .
so , you have the eye , and then you drop in the concepts .
my preference is about 70 coats of this -- matte black auto primer .
i &apos;m in that world , but i work purely instinctively .
that &apos;s the car of the future . it &apos;s a water droplet .
and i began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .

and so people think of clouds as things that get in the way .
and i &apos;ll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides .
and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it .
and new and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible .

and legend has it that alexander trekked through this desert .
again he asked me , &quot; what do you think we should do ? &quot;
and it &apos;s so easy to cause people &apos;s brains to release oxytocin .
we need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure .
paul has never seen a fossil do that .
these are all landlubbing animals . there &apos;s a couple of choices .
and perhaps most tragically , he lost his self-worth .
so let &apos;s see now how exponential technologies are taking health care .
i knew this , but i was expecting something .
and play a little banjo . let &apos;s do a little medley .
then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall .
by the way , apparently wired took all this to heart .
one way not to do it : teach more ethics courses .
it can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
and yet , to the best of our knowledge , we are alone .
and what would be behind those rubber masks , if they were ?
and it was so successful that they made it into a movie .
and here were are . we have a continuum in the world .
but it turned out there wasn &apos;t any sexual trauma .
and i needed to find something historically that would match that .
the spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip .
people always say consciousness is very hard to define .
we care how we make our profit .
but maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds .
and at the time i went into the wind business , natural gas was nine dollars .
tbp : i lost 150 million on the wind , okay .
and of course , we now ask , where do we go now ?
and anybody who would turn around i would , sort of , make a beeline for .
these tools don &apos;t get socially interesting until they get technologically boring .
and i can only try to speculate on how he did it .
what could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have ?
so i tried to do a small good thing for my wife .
there &apos;s one way to treat jaundice , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called an exchange transfusion .
my father also lived most of his adult life in east africa .
franco sacchi : so many things to say , so little time .
franco , you described this as the world &apos;s third largest film industry .
along the way , i &apos;ve had to burn a few chairs . you know ?

you can be eight feet tall . just take them off . &quot;
they got someone to come in and saw off the shoes .
let &apos;s pull this apart : i &apos;ll go ahead and explode it .
now what okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology .
and this is like 10 weeks later , demolished by hand .
i saw my aunt in rape when i was only five .
he &apos;s clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years .
this is the community that i originally showed you the slide of .
she &apos;s 23 . she &apos;s been on them ever since she was 13 .
and that is what mansukh bhai prajapati has done .
it was fished sustainably till all of time , except for our generation .
extraordinarily damaging , if you &apos;re talking about using the talents of the population .
you remember kamal earlier , holding the bamboo staff .
and i came to kosovo and advised the kosovo government .
the next thing is , that virus dna made stuff that chopped up the bacteria dna .
we climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness .
i soon realized that manspaces didn &apos;t have to be only inside .
my parents got divorced , and my sister was arrested .
kids in the 12th grade : not exactly all that enthusiastic about the american government system .
now , have a look at that . that &apos;s the anesthesiology machine .
but they don &apos;t exist . so i &apos;m having to make them .
he gets paid to leave the water in the stream .
and you can see that life expectancy was also short .
this is the best technology that this region could ever have : desalination .
and she said , &quot; i saw your talk live-streamed .
and everybody just burst into applause , and they were like &quot; yes ! &quot;
you &apos;re beginning to see the emergence of a multi-polar world .
the interrelationship of nations , well it &apos;s always existed .
i hadn &apos;t changed . my i.q. hadn &apos;t dropped .
so basically , no one would accept family planning if their children didn &apos;t survive .
i have worked with women and for women all my life .
women and children , especially the poor , are at the bottom .
and this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza .
they said we couldn &apos;t do afghanistan . we did it with ease .
what we need downstream is a great power enabled -- what i call that sys admin force .
to attack america is to risk blowing up the world .
we &apos;re roughly two days from the entrance at that point .
it can be done in seven years with the right backing .
here &apos;s a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay .
those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence .
and i came from a very privileged background . i was very lucky .
latin is relatively rare , too . you just look at some of the languages .
now to a vegetable plant , my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space .
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn &apos;t be called unproductive .
it &apos;s kind of an inspiring statement , and i &apos;ll go back at the end of this .
and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags .
the third problem with headphones is this : deafness -- noise-induced hearing disorder .
you guys are facing that way , so i &apos;ll hook it to this one .
on that self , it should be centered -- a bigness , a wholeness .
the other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons .
i &apos;m going to be showing some of the cybercriminals &apos; latest and nastiest creations .
now how do you get a usb key to run in a business ?
now you &apos;re probably wondering what happened to these guys .
otherwise , i would have liked you to have seen this .
and the man said , &quot; he &apos;s come down a long way , hasn &apos;t he ? &quot;
and i &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
i finally got to taste it before i left .
don &apos;t worry about dropping it , it &apos;s tougher than titanium .
suppose you like to square numbers , and frankly , who doesn &apos;t ?
in fact , i think many people thought that i was a bit crazy .
we can start making better , wiser , more sustainable decisions .
woolenness and wetness aren &apos;t exactly two concepts that go together .

bill davenhall : your health depends on where you live
so now i want to show you that penguins are affected .
and then there &apos;s another fellow that will leisurely come by .
so we did . and here is what it does .
completely opposite of the way you &apos;d see it on a nature film , of course .
but i &apos;m not thinking &quot; monsteret &quot; is a good thing .
now , it &apos;s kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor .
i still drive the same four-year-old ford that i &apos;ve driven .
this is actually being performed by brian mcwhorter , who is an extraordinary performer .
and so it is with archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
when i was awake , with the camera around my neck .
&quot; to make some money and to open a store &quot; was the indian road worker .
you can make a lot of change . you can get roads built .
that &apos;s the beginning of desire , that exploratory needs curiosity , discovery .
i never read a speech or a talk or a lecture .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn .
well , ultimately , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
we need new models of being a leader and a human in the world .
so how do you know if your breasts are dense ?
no , not potatoes , but tomatoes , aromatic plants and so on .
at the time , he was teaching classics at trinity college in dublin .
the incidence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
what this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it will cool itself .
&quot; and decided his top people had to be extinctified . &quot;
now , the deeper you go underwater , the higher the pressure is .
these extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments .
there are really two kinds of negative reviews that we &apos;ve received .
this is a problem that is currently lacking a solution .
and the other puzzle is that i &apos;m actually okay with that .
here &apos;s my argument . does it work ? is it any good ?
this is the opposite ; this is how we make things .
that &apos;s very exciting for fuel cells -- to be able to do that without platinum .
my first business was a dressmaking business i started under the taliban .
i said to her , &quot; you should do an experiment .
first of all , i have to say i &apos;m not from around here .
it &apos;s called &quot; untitled &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
the consequences of a planet with 7 billion people and counting .
but that doesn &apos;t tell us they necessarily had language .
it &apos;s been working to help control pandemic flu , sars for example .
with the help of people like you , we can make this dream a reality .
what are they looking at ? maybe we should be looking at it .
my belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness .
so the children said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you the average amount of bias that we see .
and so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something .
we were all upset with her , &quot; why are you doing this ?
lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs and jumped into the national movement .
guess what ? their vision is really , really good .
as we speak right now , 125 girls will never be mutilated .
that &apos;s here . that &apos;s home . that &apos;s us .
i started talking because i had studied environment .
but what about you ? what &apos;s it going to do to you ?
graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things .
because there &apos;s nothing in this . well , allegedly there &apos;s nothing .
so dopamine appears to be the drug associated with patternicity .
odds are i probably know somebody who has made a widget .
so hopefully everything has been positive , positive , positive , more positive .
if you imitate something , maybe you can have an effect on it .
the way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of behaving is broken .
the industrial design magazine , i believe , is called &quot; innovation . &quot;
we &apos;ve seen all these &quot; star treks , &quot; and they &apos;re all holodeck episodes as well .
the animals are in one of their human lives . the humans are human .
but the truth is life is being lived there .
and people called in and left messages like this .
one illustration of the transformational power of technology is in kibera .
the stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread .
that &apos;s how i ended up in solitary , because i let my feelings be known .
so in theory , you could grow any organ from any one of your cells .
but the robot can also figure out where to go on its own .
and never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact .
and meat consumption in southeast asia and china in particular is what drives the prices of cereals .
there were two studios involved : warner brothers and paramount .
and we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence .
and there &apos;s a very simple task that they need to do .
so i finished , and it was a success in a sense .
ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not being told .
that &apos;s what he thought he was there for .
but then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from propaganda .
and it &apos;s abnormal to live in a shelter .
i used to worry about the 10,000 year factor .
so i &apos;m thinking &quot; how can i do this ? &quot;
if we can see this possible future , others can too .
because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live ?
night shots are beautiful , piercing the big dipper and the milky way .
see , we &apos;re a secret club with a secret handshake .
j so many , in fact , that seeing has become a bit of a problem .
when we &apos;re dealing with people like this ?
if you &apos;re in australia , it &apos;s mostly aboriginals who are in jail .
we &apos;re about to ride the wave of technological opportunity .
we came very close to failure , but we managed to get through that point in 2008 .
how on earth has one person been able to innovate in this way ?
you can &apos;t be a professor without having been a student .
so it should look like this . you should be looking at something like this .
they can be a little skeptical ; i &apos;ll come back to that .
it means living up to your own full potential as a human being .
now , look at that ; look , it &apos;s -- she just blew me away .
so , you would just walk around london at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench .
we &apos;re getting used to a new way of being alone together .
we have to flee our women and children , we have to run . &quot;
and i drove home late that night with batteries and ice .
so who is god , if not the great puppet-master or the tribal protector ?
and i &apos;ve always felt bad about it , in a sense .
and , as many people do , he was dozing off during the sermon .
there were 114 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
but as soon as the fighting intensified , the physical rehabilitation was suspended .
so that told me right away : i need a remote control device .
i was in my 20s before i ever went to an art museum .
and we &apos;ve only got three minutes , but we could talk about it for hours .
and i went down to the room in which i was to be sleeping .
and we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .
it went for 1,114 miles , linking beijing with hangzhou and shanghai .
are you an ngo ? are you the media ? &quot;
it &apos;s very cost-effective , and it &apos;s very mesh-y .
i thought he was koo koo , but something about that really stuck .
but this brought me -- with netra managing my career -- it brought me a lot of success .
and in some parts of the world , they use tools , like sponges to hunt fish .
aren &apos;t those just the foundations of xenophobia and authoritarianism and puritanism ?
we have begun organizing makers at our maker faire .
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about lifestyles .
it took us 10 years of hard work to reach this goal .
we were four of us , not one , and fortunately no boys .
there &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
ten percent of the time people &apos;s minds are wandering when they &apos;re having sex .
time for development -- it took around 10 years and 700 million dollars .
i &apos;m right , you &apos;re wrong . shut up .
so i kind of switched . i went to mit , finished .
because they found that loss aversion is a more powerful influence on people &apos;s behavior .
self-study , self-exploration , self-empowerment : these are the virtues of a great education .
it &apos;s because i didn &apos;t have a self to get in the way .
and i said to brian , &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and the gems are always the outermost aspects of our interviewee &apos;s personality .
so the x-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners .
it is not professor and convict , it is just two minds ready to do philosophy .
and these are the kind of topics we really actually care about .
and we saw over and over the way that spoken word poetry cracks open locks .
my parents named me sarah , which is a biblical name .
a prosthetic limb doesn &apos;t represent the need to replace loss anymore .
i was in beijing &apos;s bidding for the olympic games .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t look fat in that , no . &quot;
six months after that , with no explanation , they let me go .
bl : these worms have no digestive system . they have no mouth .
they &apos;re private schools . there are no state schools in slums .
well , the key is motivation , and there are two aspects to it .
you can see that the lines cross when the population explodes .
but i will tell you some of my favorite discoveries from the census .
mitchell joachim : don &apos;t build your home , grow it !
it &apos;s not in the abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
so i thought , &quot; i will talk about death . &quot;
and let me tell you , corn is in everything .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group self-identifies itself as extreme .
they made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin .
that is like an anish kapoor flowing through a richard serra .
another example of the impact of glass buildings on the life of birds .
we can show results . we can make things better .
i &apos;m going to tell you about how i learned something about life .
i was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive .
here you can see that knife went through the heart .
so here is where we were after the first graduation in 2004 .
the question remains : what happens when the music stops ?
thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online .
thought he could turn back the waves ; couldn &apos;t turn back the waves .
reading and writing dna code is getting easier and cheaper .
at the very least i hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights .
and that eye specialist , he didn &apos;t bother testing my eyes .
i &apos;m not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other .
and so there &apos;s no way that this is going to work . &quot;
recently , i &apos;ve also made some rather highbrow baroque borders out of lowbrow pasta .
i &apos;m certain i can see you blushing .
i sat at my desk . i used my expensive computer .
now within that framework , we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things .
none in india . there are now at least a half a million active .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s so interesting actually .
but it is so scary to think of ourselves as that powerful .
nerves , if they are injured , can cause paralysis , can cause pain .
if you &apos;re the second site there , most people link to you .
and we now have 350-pound auto workers learning bird songs on the internet .
we take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray .
kt : no , no , i &apos;m just still looking at the road .
i &apos;ve got one more thing to share with you right now .
another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities .
when he was writing a broadway show , i would be outside of the door .
prevention must be part of the solution -- we emphasize that .
but it was deeper . it was , how much life is there left ?
this is a called a &quot; diff , &quot; this thing on the right here .
but i &apos;m afraid that ricky will come out here and shake his fist at me .
i &apos;d read lots of books . i studied maps and charts .
this is coming from a jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot .
was not very successful . and so on and so forth .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
and this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals .
so , this is normal dna , what you think of as normal dna .
sm : well , actually the cost that we incurred was less than 200 rupees .
there is depth records , where people go as deep as they can .
as a magician i try to show things to people that seem impossible .
and if that were all this was about , then it would be an interesting thing .
and just in the last 5,000 years , in increasing rates , over increasing distances .
right ? it needs to be alert , for which caffeine is very good .
we &apos;ve managed to do that in the last 100 to 150 years .
i have talked about it a million times , but it &apos;s unbelievable .
this is a state diagram . that &apos;s an extremely simple computer .
if not , one or the other needs upgrading , isn &apos;t it ?
don &apos;t make it africa . don &apos;t make it a race issue .
and now , 14 of the disorders are treatable , two of them actually curable .
so what you need to do is figure out who does care .
and 23 years after , they called us to develop -- we &apos;re developing this idea .
they marched into the center of reykjavik , and they put women &apos;s issues onto the agenda .
and then i &apos;m in the control room here , playing back and forth .
you &apos;ve got major cerebellar activity , which is involved in motor coordination .
it &apos;s produced by the malaria parasite and it &apos;s a very interesting crystalline substance .
and yet the more you add , the more seems to go missing .
ourbeginning.com. life &apos;s an event . announce it to the world .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise , surprise .
i read &quot; peter and the wolf &quot; with this beautiful band from juilliard .
im : are you freaking out ? you look so cute .
if you &apos;ve ever overbeaten your whipped cream , it &apos;s actually buttermilk .
he traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them .
this is the clonal creosote bush , which is around 12,000 years old .
he said , &quot; but i understand that . &quot; he said , &quot; i understand that . &quot;
you know , video games can be truly deep even when they &apos;re completely mindless .
and it &apos;s one of the nicest pieces i &apos;ve ever made , i think .
don &apos;t take the thrill of it away . i &apos;d rather be mystified .
we are , you are , the most underused resource in health care .
and so , what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances .
but again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that really eats insects .
and some might think , well they &apos;re not yet available .
and in this book , little lewis would know the big idea .
so , the first robot to talk about is called strider .
welcome to romela , the robotics mechanisms laboratory at virginia tech .
but just a spark of imagination is not good enough .
on those , it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground .
so we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we &apos;ll have more results to report soon .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and came down from on high .
fifty percent of the world &apos;s computers end up in china to be recycled .
the traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals .
that &apos;s my story shared in the form of a lesson .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not yet too late .
in over 175 societies , people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system .
now , most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
it was about all children . so , we were shameless .
so for example , we would put models under an artificial sky .
i mean , a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean .
doing what ? breaking stones , digging earth .
that &apos;s the only space she could express her creativity .
and in our analysis of the american states , we find rather the same contrast .
and it &apos;s about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage .
and &quot; the end of print &quot; is now in its fifth printing .
before that , obviously , technology didn &apos;t exist . but obviously it did .
i first became fascinated with octopus at an early age .
and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us .
i thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem .
it made him very unpopular . they didn &apos;t want to go back to square one .
then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed with thick leather straps .
final story , and i sort of have to speak quickly .
and we as africans need to start challenging our leaders .
now riley &apos;s going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here .
and you know the kind i &apos;m talking about . i &apos;m talking about pollution .
at the time , we knew that it was political .
okay ? and all you have to guide you are your two eyes .
and then aids education in all schools , starting from university .
people don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it .
art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society .
it is the largest lake in the world . it &apos;s 800 km long .
now , that &apos;s a lot , a lot of bees , and that &apos;s really important .
and i also whistled at a christmas eve party with my family-in-law .
it &apos;s in its early stages , but this is what it looks like right now .
now , children below the age of consent are a special case .
i &apos;m leaving you with a little more birdsong , which is very good for you .
you learn swimming by swimming . you learn cycling by cycling .
this looks like a plant , but it &apos;s actually an animal .
the ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes pictured by intuition .
if you want your rivals to go offline , well , they will .
there are a few other interesting pieces the cybercriminals had uploaded .
the adults can recognize the juveniles ; the juveniles can recognize the adults .
and when you use these things you don &apos;t have to go like that .
mentoring me . he &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
frank wilson had written a book called &quot; the hand . &quot;
there are no slides , so you &apos;ll just have to be content with me .
ks : now the way it works : there &apos;s a matrix of color dyes .
there is some danger , there is some trap . one trap : the vertical .
now i &apos;ve got a live demonstration over here to show this to you .
a line that the dalai lama once said , he said , &quot; love and compassion are necessities .
we &apos;ll start with a one-by-one square and next to that put another one-by-one square .
but above all , they started to do serious business with the world of crime .
and that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
but the real question is : how well do these work in practice ?
and i will be in your corner for the rest of your life . &quot;
instead of turning to friends or relatives , they looked to david &apos;s workplace .
i &apos;m here to show you how something you can &apos;t see can be so much fun to look at .
it makes it a really fun place to work .
i think it was that interaction that led to personal computing .
so here &apos;s a typical situation , male meets female , lots of offspring .
as i explained earlier , plants extract phosphorus from the soil , through water .
and instead of using a 100 percent dose , i &apos;m going to reduce it to 25 percent .
but i can &apos;t put in an electrode and say , &quot; go there . &quot;
and that &apos;s where our goal is -- to have something clinically pragmatic to wear .
either case , it &apos;s bad news for the corals of the galapagos islands .
and what &apos;s true for sensory information is true for information generally .
whether you believe it &apos;s true or not -- it really didn &apos;t matter to me .
so , he &apos;s going , &quot; what &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
and i &apos;d get a terse response : &quot; oh , that &apos;s worse . &quot;
this is sydney , who &apos;s going to be three years old in a couple of days .
i &apos;m not quite sure why , but we &apos;ve done it anyway .
but as the electrons go round at the speed of light , they shed x-rays .
because institutions at the moment confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing .
the really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it .
it &apos;s a type of fossilized dental plaque that is called officially dental calculus .
for those of you in the back , it says here : &quot; then a miracle occurs .
the reason ? today &apos;s current modern medicine is a 60-year-old technique .
we are below average in terms of traffic incidents in the city .
my aunt , an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman , was widowed early .
she was the most determined advocate for women &apos;s rights i had ever heard .
it is because you are â€” you know what you are .
went up to the floor , the second floor , and said : &quot; hey , guys .
